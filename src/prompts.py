• **TOTAL MESSAGES:** <total_messages>
• **BATCH_SIZE:** <batch_size> (i.e., <num_batches> batches)
• **LABELS:** <provided_labels>
• **USER PROFILE:** <user_profile>

═══════════════ CORE OBJECTIVE ═══════════════
Generate <num_batches> distinct, non-repetitive batch plans that form a coherent development narrative arc where a real developer naturally converses with an AI assistant. Each plan must introduce NEW technical elements while maintaining perfect continuity and project consistency.

═══════════════ REAL-WORLD CODING CHAT FRAMEWORK ═══════════════
This is about creating realistic coding conversations that mirror how developers actually interact with AI assistants:

**PRIMARY INTERACTION PATTERNS:**
1. **Code Implementation Requests:** "I need to build/create/implement..."
2. **Debugging Help:** "I'm getting this error..." / "This code isn't working..."
3. **Code Review/Optimization:** "Can you review this code?" / "How can I optimize this?"

**REALISTIC DEVELOPMENT FLOW:**
- Developer works on features → encounters bugs → seeks debugging help
- Developer implements basic functionality → seeks optimization advice
- Developer plans architecture → requests implementation assistance
- Developer completes features → needs testing/deployment guidance
- Developer faces new requirements → seeks implementation strategies

═══════════════ STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════

- Each bullet: "• **[LABEL CATEGORY]:**[LABEL DESCRIPTION]:** [content]" (≤25 words)
- NOTE: Each label consists of category and description. Use both for each bullet point.
- Use only the provided LABELS - no custom categories
- CRITICAL: Add one time anchor bulletpoint at the begining of each batch with this format: Month Day, Year.
**NOTE**: Time anchor must correlated with other dates in the batch and the time anchors among batches should be increasing and time anchor in each batch should be before the dates mentioned in the batches.

- Conceptual misunderstandings with specific confusion points
- Calculation errors with exact mistake locations
- Method selection dilemmas with pros/cons
- Time pressure challenges with specific deadlines
- Prerequisite knowledge gaps with missing concepts
- Application difficulties with real-world connections

═══════════════ ANTI-REPETITION VERIFICATION ═══════════════

**Before writing ANY bullet, verify:**
- Have I included at least one specific, verifiable mathematical detail?
- Can this generate a question with a numerical or factual answer?
- Does this show MEASURABLE progression from previous mathematical understanding?
- Are the equations, values, and theorem names specific?
- Is this a NEW mathematical challenge or concept?

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Vague time references ("recently", "soon") without specific dates or class periods
- General math mentions ("algebra", "calculus") without specific topics/problems
- Unspecified results ("did well", "understood better") without scores/metrics
- Abstract outcomes ("made progress", "had difficulty") without mathematical details
- Repeated problem types (same equation structure, same concept explanation, same error type)

═══════════════ CONTENT DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY ═══════════════

**Per Batch Requirements:**
- 2-3 bullets: Problem-solving activities with specific equations/solutions
- 1-2 bullets: Current learning status with measurable metrics
- 1 bullet: Exact temporal anchor (specific date/time)
- 4-6 bullets: Mathematical activities with verifiable outcomes
- 2-3 bullets: Learning decisions with specific alternatives considered
- 1 bullet: **Preference Statement**: implicitly showing learning preferences
- Rest: Using remaining labels with concrete mathematical details

**Adaptive Batch Planning:**
Each batch should organically focus on what makes sense for that learning phase:

**Concept-Heavy Batch:**
- Multiple conceptual understanding requests
- Definition clarification
- Theorem explanation
- Foundational knowledge building

**Problem-Solving Batch:**
- Specific problem assistance
- Solution strategy development

- "Help me set up the integral for the area between y = x² and y = 2x"
- "I need to prove that √2 is irrational but don't know where to start"

**Concept Clarification:**
- "I don't understand why the limit of sin(x)/x as x→0 equals 1"
- "Can you explain why P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B) only for independent events?"
- "What does it mean for a function to be continuous at x = 2?"

**Solution Verification:**
- "Can you check if I factored x³ - 8 = (x-2)(x² + 2x + 4) correctly?"
- "Is my critical point at x = 3 actually a maximum for f(x) = -x² + 6x + 1?"
- "Did I apply L'Hôpital's rule correctly to lim(x→0) (e^x - 1)/x?"

**Method Explanation:**
- "Why does completing the square always work for solving quadratics?"
- "Show me step-by-step how to find eigenvalues of a 3×3 matrix"
- "Explain how to test if the series Σ(1/n²) converges"

═══════════════ QUALITY STANDARDS ═══════════════

# ================================ add special bullets ================================

add_special_bulletpoints_to_plan_implicit = """
You are a specialized editor that adds three specific test bullets to existing batch plans for synthetic conversation generation.

## INPUT & TASK
- **PLAN:** <plan>
- For EACH batch: Keep ALL <num_bullets> original bullets unchanged, ADD exactly 3 bullets at positions <num_bullets>+1, <num_bullets>+2, <num_bullets>+3

## MANDATORY OUTPUT STRUCTURE
Each batch MUST have EXACTLY <num_bullets>+3 bullets:
- Bullets 1-<num_bullets>: Original bullets (unchanged)
- Bullet <num_bullets>+1: Information Update
- Bullet <num_bullets>+2: User Instruction  
- Bullet <num_bullets>+3: Logical Contradiction

## THE THREE SPECIAL BULLETS

### 1. INFORMATION UPDATE (Bullet <num_bullets>+1)
**Format:** `• **Information Update:** [Natural narrative containing update]`

**MANDATORY PRE-CHECK:**
1. SCAN bullets 1-<num_bullets>-2 for EXPLICIT numerical/measurable data
2. IDENTIFY exact number, time, date, or measurement
3. VERIFY value is clearly stated in original text
4. ONLY THEN create update changing that exact value

EXAMPLES:
Original: "completed 8 tasks" → Update: "completed 12 tasks"
Original: "budget of $1,500" → Update: "budget of $2,200"
Original: "meeting at 3:00 PM" → Update: "meeting at 4:30 PM"
Original: "team of 6 people" → Update: "team of 9 people"
Original: "scored 82%" → Update: "scored 91%"
Original: "June 15th deadline" → Update: "July 8th deadline"
"increased the number of tasks completed" (vague, no specific numbers)
"improved the budget allocation" (vague, no specific amounts)

**CRITICAL:** Make update IMPLICIT - embed new value in natural narrative, don't state "X is now Y"

**Update Categories (rotate through all):**
1. Numerical shifts (prices, quantities, measurements)
2. Status changes (employment, relationships, health)
3. Location changes (addresses, venues, destinations)
4. Relationship progressions (social connections)
5. Skill/Education levels (certifications, proficiency)
6. Circumstance shifts (living, ownership, availability)
7. Time/Schedule changes (appointments, deadlines)
8. Quantity adjustments (group sizes, inventory)
9. Preference evolution (tastes, choices, priorities)
10. Health/Wellness updates (conditions, fitness)
11. Technology/Tool changes (software, platforms)
12. Financial status shifts (income, savings)

**VERIFICATION:** STOP if no matching fact exists in bullets 1-<num_bullets>-2.

### 2. USER INSTRUCTION (Bullet <num_bullets>+2)
**Format:** `• **User Instruction:** Always [action] when I ask about [condition]`

**MANDATORY FORMAT:** Must include "when I ask about" - this makes it testable.

**Instruction Types (rotate through all):**
1. Output formatting rules
2. Content restrictions
3. Personal preferences
4. Conditional responses
5. Time-based rules
6. Priority rules
7. Cultural preferences
8. Safety protocols

**EXAMPLES:**
`Always show prices including tax when I ask about costs`
`Always suggest vegetarian options first when I ask about restaurants`
`Always show prices including tax` (missing "when I ask about")

### 3. LOGICAL CONTRADICTION (Bullet <num_bullets>+3)
**Format:** `• **Logical Contradiction:** [Contradicting fact only]`

**CRITICAL PRE-CHECK:**
1. SCAN bullets 1-<num_bullets>-2 for COMPLETED ACTIONS or PERMANENT STATES:
   - Past tense actions: "visited", "ate", "traveled", "lived"
   - Permanent conditions: "born in", "raised as", "died in"
   - Absolute statements: "never did X", "always was Y"
2. FIND exactly ONE target fact to contradict
3. IF NO COMPLETED ACTIONS EXIST: CREATE setup bullet with completed action, insert between bullets 5-<num_bullets>-2, THEN contradict in bullet <num_bullets>+4

FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES (NEVER USE):
"Before this batch", "In this batch", "Previously", "Earlier", "Despite", "Although", "Even though", "However", "But", "Contrary to", "Unlike", "Instead of", "Rather than", "Opposite to", "In contrast"

**RULE:** Only contradict COMPLETED ACTIONS, never plans/intentions.

TEMPORAL QUALIFIER PROBLEM:
- Original: "I attended 5 client meetings last week"
- Wrong: "I have never attended client meetings before this project" (creates timeline loophole - could be true)
- Right: "I have never attended any client meetings" (absolute contradiction - impossible)

FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES (NEVER USE):
"Before this batch", "In this batch", "Previously", "Earlier", "Despite", "Although", "Even though", "However", "But", "Contrary to", "Unlike", "Instead of", "Rather than", "Opposite to", "In contrast",
"Before this session", "Before this study plan", "Before this study plan", "Before this plan",
"Before this batch", "Before this course", "Before this []"

**CRITICAL:** Contradiction must make the **same original event/fact IMPOSSIBLE**, not describe a different event with different outcomes.

**WRONG APPROACH:**
- Original: "Completed 8 coding problems yesterday; solved 6 correctly"  
- Wrong: "Completed 8 coding problems yesterday; solved all 8 correctly" (different outcome, just better performance)

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
- Original: "Completed 8 coding problems yesterday; solved 6 correctly"
- Right: "I've never worked on coding problems before" (makes original impossible)

**Contradiction Types (use variety):**
1. Age/Time Reversal: Age going backward
2. Death Resurrection: Dead people doing activities  
3. Never-Statement Violations: Contradicting "never" claims
4. Location Impossibilities: Being in two places simultaneously
5. Only-Statement Conflicts: Contradicting exclusivity

**VERIFICATION:**
✓ Original is COMPLETED ACTION (past tense)?
✓ Contradiction makes original IMPOSSIBLE, not just different?
✓ Reads like normal, natural statement with NO hint words?
✓ Avoided ALL forbidden words that suggest conflict?

## CRITICAL VERIFICATION STEPS
**Information Update:**
- ✓ Can you point to EXACT number/time/date from bullets 1-<num_bullets>-2?
- ✓ Changing ONLY that specific value?

**Logical Contradiction:**
- ✓ Can you point to EXACT bullet (1-<num_bullets>-2) being contradicted?
- ✓ Original fact is COMPLETED ACTION, not plan?
- ✓ Contradiction is IMPOSSIBLE, not just different?
- ✓ NOT using FORBIDDEN WORDS/PHRASES mentioned in LOGICAL CONTRADICTION section

## COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID
Don't place special bullets anywhere except <num_bullets>+1, <num_bullets>+2, <num_bullets>+3
Don't modify original <num_bullets> bullets
Don't skip any of the three special bullets
Don't use other labels for special bullets

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Return COMPLETE plan where each batch has ALL original bullets unchanged + exactly 3 additional bullets at the end. When setup fact is created, insert between bullets 5-<num_bullets>-2, renumber, and add special bullets as <num_bullets>+2, <num_bullets>+3, <num_bullets>+4.

Begin processing the plan now.

- **USER PROFILE:** <user_profile>
- **USER RELATIONSHIPS:** <user_relationships>

═══════════════ CORE OBJECTIVE ═══════════════
Transform the broad plan by:
1. COMPLETELY REWRITING each bullet with maximum specific details (preserve bullet structure, not content)
2. ADDING 5+ new bullets per batch with required categories
3. Outputting ONLY the enhanced plan with extreme detail density

═══════════════ CRITICAL DETAIL REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════

**MANDATORY DETAILS IN EVERY BULLET (Minimum 3-5 per bullet):**

- Format: "• **[LABEL CATEGORY]:[LABEL DESCRIPTION]:** [completely rewritten content]"

**New Bullet Placement:**
- Distribute throughout batch for narrative flow
- Don't cluster all new bullets at end
- Integrate naturally with rewritten content

═══════════════ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ═══════════════

Each bullet must enable these questions:
□ "What was the exact price/amount?" → specific number
□ "When did this happen?" → specific date/time
□ "Where did this occur?" → named location
□ "What was chosen?" → specific selection
□ "Who was involved?" → full names
□ "What was the outcome?" → measurable result

═══════════════ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTES ═══════════════

1. REWRITE COMPLETELY - Do not preserve ANY original wording
2. PACK WITH DETAILS - Every bullet needs 5+ specific facts
3. ADD ALL 5 CATEGORIES - Each batch must have all required new bullet types
4. MAXIMUM SPECIFICITY - Names, numbers, dates in EVERY bullet
5. OUTPUT ONLY ENHANCED - No original content in output

If a bullet cannot be packed with specific details, completely reimagine it with concrete scenarios that fit the theme while enabling factual questions.

Begin transformation now. Output ONLY the detail-packed version.

# Plan Refinement and Quality Control Prompt

You are a narrative quality control specialist. Your task is to refine and fix an existing set of batch plans to eliminate repetitive content and ensure perfect temporal consistency.

## INPUT DATA
• **TOPIC:** <topic>
• **THEME:** <theme>
• **ORIGINAL PLANS:** <generated_plans>

═══════════════ REFINEMENT OBJECTIVES ═══════════════

**PRIMARY ISSUES TO RESOLVE:**
1. **Eliminate Repetitive Content:** Remove any repeated concepts, phrases, or similar descriptions across all batches
2. **Fix Temporal Inconsistencies:** Ensure all time anchors and timeline references are perfectly aligned and chronologically coherent

═══════════════ REPETITION DETECTION & ELIMINATION ═══════════════

**Step 1: Cross-Batch Content Analysis**
- Scan ALL batches for repeated phrases, concepts, or similar descriptions
- Identify bullets that cover the same topic contents without meaningful progression
- Flag any labels that have static or template-like content across batches

**Step 2: Content Diversification**
For each identified repetition:
- **Keep the FIRST meaningful occurrence** of a concept
- **Replace subsequent repetitions** with:
  - Genuine story progression/evolution of that element
  - Completely different but relevant content for that label
  - New angles or perspectives that advance the narrative

**Step 3: Label Content Variety Verification**
Ensure each label category shows diverse content across batches:
- **Same label ≠ same type of content**
- Each occurrence should represent a different aspect, stage, or development
- Avoid formulaic patterns (e.g., always starting with "I need to..." for planning labels)

═══════════════ TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY FRAMEWORK ═══════════════

**Step 1: Timeline Anchor Analysis**
- Extract ALL temporal references from every batch (dates, timeframes, "last week," "tomorrow," etc.)
- Create a chronological map of the entire story timeline
- Identify any contradictions, overlaps, or impossible sequences

**Step 2: Temporal Logic Correction**
Fix temporal inconsistencies by:
- **Establishing a clear chronological backbone** across all batches
- **Aligning time anchors** with story progression (Batch 1 = earliest, Batch N = latest)
- **Ensuring realistic time gaps** between batches (days/weeks/months as appropriate)
- **Making timeline references internally consistent** within each batch

**Step 3: Progressive Time Integration**
- Each batch should feel like it occurs AFTER the previous batch
- Reference past events with appropriate temporal language ("last month," "after our discussion," etc.)
- Future references in early batches should connect to later batch content
- Maintain realistic pacing for story developments

═══════════════ SPECIFIC REFINEMENT RULES ═══════════════

**For Repetitive Content:**
- **Relationship dynamics:** E.g. If "conflict with x" appears in Batch 2, Batch 4 should show "resolution/growth with x" not another conflict
- **Professional challenges:** Don't repeat the same work problem - show progression, new challenges, or outcomes
- **Personal goals:** Evolve from "planning to learn y" → "struggling with y" → "y breakthrough moment"
- **Emotional states:** Avoid repeated anxiety/stress descriptions - show emotional journey and growth

**For Temporal Issues:**
- **Time anchor bullets:** Must create a clear chronological sequence (Week 1 → Week 3 → Month 2, etc.)
- **Event references:** "Last week's meeting" in Batch 3 should align with content from Batch 4
- **Future planning:** Plans made in early batches should have outcomes/updates in later batches
- **Seasonal/calendar references:** Ensure holidays, seasons, months progress logically

═══════════════ QUALITY ENHANCEMENT GUIDELINES ═══════════════

**Content Enrichment:**
- Replace generic content with specific, unique details
- Add authentic personal touches and cultural specificity
- Include realistic complications and unexpected developments
- Show genuine character growth and learning

**Narrative Cohesion:**
- Ensure each batch builds meaningfully on previous content
- Create clear cause-and-effect relationships between batches
- Maintain consistent character voice and personality
- Include callbacks to earlier events that show story continuity

**Authenticity Standards:**
- Make every bullet sound like something a real person would discuss with an AI
- Include realistic emotional responses to story developments
- Show genuine human complexity (contradictions, growth, setbacks)
- Maintain believable pacing for life changes and relationship evolution

═══════════════ OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════

**Format:** Return the complete refined planset with the same structure:
- Same number of batches and bullets per batch
- Same label format: "• **[LABEL CATEGORY]:**** [LABEL DESCRIPTION]:** [refined content]"
- Each bullet ≤25 words
- Maintain all original story elements while eliminating repetition and fixing temporal issues

**Verification Checklist (before finalizing):**
- [ ] No repeated phrases or concepts across any batches
- [ ] All temporal references are chronologically consistent
- [ ] Each label shows genuine variety and progression across batches
- [ ] Story flows logically from Batch 1 to final batch
- [ ] Time anchors create a coherent timeline backbone
- [ ] All relationship arcs show realistic evolution
- [ ] Content remains authentic and conversation-appropriate

═══════════════ EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS ═══════════════

1. **First Pass:** Identify and map all repetitive content and temporal inconsistencies
2. **Second Pass:** Systematically replace repetitive content with progressive alternatives
3. **Third Pass:** Align all temporal references into a coherent chronological sequence
4. **Final Pass:** Verify narrative flow, authenticity, and overall story coherence

**CRITICAL:** Maintain the core story and character integrity while fixing these specific issues. The refined plans should feel like a polished, coherent narrative ready for high-quality dialogue generation.

Begin refinement now.

"""

message_generation_missing_details_prompt = """
You are a detail verification assistant. Your task is to check if ALL specific details from the source content have been covered in the generated output, and ADD missing details to existing output items with minimal changes.

## INPUT DATA
**SOURCE CONTENT:** <FOCUSED_BULLETS>
**GENERATED OUTPUT:** <GENERATED_QUESTIONS>

## YOUR TASK

### Step 1: Extract Details from Source Content
**CRITICAL**: Extract ONLY factual details from the actual content
- Skip any metadata, labels, prefixes, or categories
- Focus on concrete information: names, numbers, dates, locations, specifications, actions, etc.
- Include ALL specific facts, figures, and descriptions

List format:
```
Detail 1: [specific detail]
Detail 2: [specific detail]
Detail 3: [specific detail]
```

### Step 2: Systematic Coverage Check with Evidence

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL**
For EACH detail from Step 1, you MUST:

1. **STATE** exactly what you're searching for
2. **SEARCH** through ALL output items systematically
3. **QUOTE** the exact text where you found it (if found)
4. **MARK** as COVERED or MISSING with evidence

Use this template for EACH detail:
```
Searching for: "[exact detail]"
Scanning output:
- Item 1: [quote relevant portion if found, or "not present"]
- Item 2: [quote relevant portion if found, or "not present"]
- Item 3: [quote relevant portion if found, or "not present"]
[Continue for ALL items]
FOUND IN: Item [#] - "[exact quote showing the detail]"
STATUS: ✓ COVERED
```

Or if genuinely missing:
```
Searching for: "[exact detail]"
Scanning output:
- Item 1: [checked full text - not present]
- Item 2: [checked full text - not present]
[All items checked]
FOUND IN: None
STATUS: ✗ MISSING
```

**GOLDEN RULE**: When in doubt, mark as COVERED. Only mark as MISSING if you can prove it's nowhere in ANY output item.

### Step 3: Add Missing Details (Only if needed)

For EACH missing detail:
- Add to ONLY ONE output item where it fits naturally
- Make MINIMAL changes
- Keep original intent and structure
- Maintain natural flow and coherence
- Preserve any formatting or numbering
- DO NOT create new items
- DO NOT force unrelated details

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION**: Before marking ANY detail as MISSING:
   - Re-read EVERY output item completely
   - Check for synonyms and variations
   - Look for implied or paraphrased mentions
   - Only mark MISSING if absolutely certain

2. **EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT**: You MUST show where you looked and quote what you found

3. **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**:
   - Marking details as missing without checking all items
   - Missing paraphrased or reworded mentions
   - Ignoring partial matches or related terms
   - ✓ Only marking missing after proving absence with quotes

4. **OUTPUT RULES**:
   - If ALL details are covered: Return ONLY "NO"
   - If details are missing: Return ALL items (modified + unchanged)
   - NEVER create new items
   - Keep SAME NUMBER of items

## SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALIZING
Ask yourself:
- Did I check EVERY output item for EACH detail?
- Did I quote evidence for my findings?
- Am I 100% certain about each MISSING mark?
- Did I only add details that make logical sense?

## OUTPUT FORMAT

**MANDATORY**: End your response with EXACTLY this format:

**If nothing is missing:**
```
FINAL_OUTPUT:
NO
```

**If details are missing:**
```
FINAL_OUTPUT:
[item 1 - possibly modified]
[item 2 - possibly modified]
[item 3 - possibly modified]
[all items must be included]
```

## EXAMPLE VERIFICATION PROCESS

**Example 1: Technical Documentation**

**Source Content:**
API endpoint /users/profile accepts GET requests, returns JSON with fields: user_id (integer), email (string), created_at (ISO 8601), subscription_tier (basic/premium/enterprise), rate limit 100 requests per minute.

**Generated Output:**
- The profile endpoint accepts GET requests and returns user data in JSON format
- Response includes user identification and account information
- Standard rate limiting applies to prevent abuse

**Verification:**
```
Searching for: "/users/profile"
- Item 1: "profile endpoint" (partial, missing full path) ⚠
- Item 2: not present
- Item 3: not present
STATUS: ✗ MISSING (full path not specified)

Searching for: "user_id"
- Item 1: not present
- Item 2: "user identification" (implied but not specific) ⚠

# ******************************

coding_message_generation_prompt = """
You are generating realistic coding questions that a DEVELOPER would ask an AI ASSISTANT. Your ONLY job is to create technical questions based on the SPECIFIC DETAILS mentioned in the bullet points below.

## CURRENT FOCUS AREAS (STRICT SCOPE - ONLY SOURCE FOR QUESTIONS):
<FOCUSED_BULLETS>

## QUESTIONS ALREADY COVERED IN THIS BATCH (AVOID THESE):
<BATCH_HISTORY>

## CURRENT BATCH CONTEXT (AWARENESS ONLY - DO NOT GENERATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS):
<PREVIOUS_SUB_BATCH_PLANS>

## PREVIOUS BATCH PLANS [DEVELOPMENT REFERENCE DATABASE] (REFERENCE ONLY & AWARENESS ONLY - DO NOT GENERATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS):
<PREVIOUS_BATCH_PLANS>

CRITICAL: These sections provide REFERENCE INFORMATION to help you understand project context, previous implementations, tech stack decisions, and code evolution mentioned in the current bullet points. Use this information to understand WHAT has been built, WHICH technologies are being used, and WHAT previous development happened, but NEVER generate questions directly about topics from these reference sections.

---

## CRITICAL RULES:

### 1. ABSOLUTE BULLET-POINT COVERAGE RULE
**CRITICAL: Mention all the details in the given FOCUSED_BULLETS (numbers, names, dates, technical detail, implementation, error, or coding situation mentioned) at least once across the questions you generate.**
**STRICT VERIFICATION CHECKLIST** - Before each question, ask:
1. Is this exact detail explicitly mentioned in a current bullet point in FOCUSED_BULLETS?
2. Am I staying within the precise scope of what's mentioned?
**ALLOWED**: Questions about the exact words, phrases, technical details, implementations, errors, or coding situations written in bullets in FOCUSED_BULLETS

### 2. DETAIL ESTABLISHMENT & REFERENCE RULE - **ANTI-REPETITION PRIORITY**
**CRITICAL: Mention specific details from bullet points in FOCUSED_BULLETS ONLY ONCE, then use natural references**
**DETAIL USAGE PATTERN:**
- **First mention**: Include full specific details from bullet point in FOCUSED_BULLETS (names, dates, numbers, exact function names, variable names, error messages, file names, version numbers, etc.)
- **All subsequent questions**: Use pronouns, references, or contextual shortcuts
- **Natural progression**: Questions evolve from establishing details to exploring implications

### 3. BULLET-POINT EXTRACTION RULE
- Read each bullet point word by word
- Identify EVERY specific technical detail, error, implementation, or coding situation mentioned
- Create questions ONLY about these extracted technical elements
- IGNORE the general programming topic/theme - focus solely on bullet point specifics

### 4. FORBIDDEN EXPANSION
- Do NOT ask about the broader programming topic (React in general, etc.)
- Do NOT ask generic questions about the technology stack
- Do NOT add technical information not mentioned in the bullet points
- Do NOT create educational questions about programming concepts
- ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT generate questions directly about topics from reference sections
- Use reference info only to understand context for current bullet points

### 5. REFERENCE DATABASE USAGE
- Use "CURRENT BATCH CONTEXT" and "DEVELOPMENT REFERENCE DATABASE" to understand technical references in current bullet points
- If current bullets mention a component/function without context, check reference sections to understand what it does
- If current bullets mention a technology without context, check reference sections to understand the implementation
- If current bullets reference past code, use reference sections to understand what was built
- **KEY**: Use reference info to UNDERSTAND current bullets, but generate questions ONLY about current bullet content

### 6. CODING QUESTION GENERATION STRATEGY
For each specific technical element in the bullet points, create questions that follow these patterns:

**CODE IMPLEMENTATION REQUESTS:**
- "Help me build/create/implement [specific feature from bullet]"
- "Can you write [specific code component from bullet]"
- "Show me how to [specific technical task from bullet]"
- "I need to create [specific functionality from bullet]"

**DEBUGGING HELP:**
- "I'm getting this error: [specific error from bullet]. How do I fix it?"
- "My [specific code/feature from bullet] isn't working as expected"
- "Why does [specific function/component from bullet] return [specific issue]?"
- "This [specific code from bullet] is throwing [specific error]"

**CODE REVIEW/OPTIMIZATION:**
- "Can you review this [specific code from bullet] and suggest improvements?"
- "How can I optimize [specific implementation from bullet]?"
- "Is there a better way to [specific approach from bullet]?"
- "What's wrong with my [specific code from bullet]?"

### 7. CHRONOLOGICAL ORDERING RULE
- Process bullet points in the exact order provided
- Questions must follow the chronological sequence of the bullet points
- Earlier bullet point details should appear in earlier questions
- Later bullet point details should appear in later questions

### 8. PROJECT INTRODUCTION HANDLING
- DO NOT include project introductions in questions unless it's the very first batch of the entire conversation series
- Assume the AI assistant already knows the project context from previous conversations
- Jump straight into the technical question without re-introducing the project
- Reference project components naturally without formal introduction: "my Flask app", "this React component", "the user authentication", etc.

### 9. TEMPORAL ANCHOR HANDLING
- If bullet points mention specific development times (deadlines, milestones, "next sprint", "recently implemented", etc.), incorporate that timing naturally into questions
- Do NOT mention the label name "temporal anchor" or reference it explicitly
- Use the timing context naturally: "I need to deploy by Friday..." or "Since we're starting the new sprint..." or "I just implemented..."

### 10. AUTHENTIC DEVELOPER CONVERSATION STYLE
**CRITICAL: These must sound like REAL DEVELOPERS texting/chatting, not formal technical documentation.**

**Language Authenticity:**
- Use lots of contractions: "I'm", "don't", "can't", "it's", "that's", "won't"
- Include casual dev slang: "lol", "btw", "tbh", "kinda", "sorta", "gonna", "wanna"
- Add filler words: "like", "um", "you know", "I mean", "so", "well"
- Use informal punctuation: multiple periods "...", question marks "??", exclamation points "!!"

**Technical Authenticity:**
- Include actual error messages when mentioned in bullets
- Reference specific file names, function names, variables from bullets
- Use realistic technical scenarios that developers actually encounter
- Include version numbers, framework names, configuration details when mentioned

**Imperfect Natural Speech:**
- Include minor typos and informal grammar
- Use incomplete thoughts: "so I was trying to..." or "not sure if this makes sense but..."
- Add rambling elements: "I mean, I guess what I'm trying to implement is..." 
- Include thinking out loud: "hmm", "wait", "actually", "oh", "maybe"

**Emotional Authenticity:**
- Show genuine developer feelings: frustration with bugs, excitement about features, confusion about errors
- Use emotional language: "I'm so confused by this error", "this bug is driving me crazy", "I'm super excited about this feature"
- Add personal reactions: "ugh", "omg", "yay", "oof", "wtf", "fml"

**Varied Question Structures:**
- Mix short and long questions
- Some incomplete questions: "so about that API thing..."
- Some statements that imply questions: "not sure what's wrong with my code..."
- Avoid repetitive "Can you help me..." or "How do I..." patterns

**Natural Developer Flow Patterns:**
- Start some questions mid-thought about code
- Include context rambling before getting to the technical point
- Add uncertainty markers: "maybe", "I think", "I'm not sure but", "does that make sense?"
- Use conversational bridges: "oh and also", "btw", "speaking of which", "another thing"

**EXAMPLES OF AUTHENTIC DEVELOPER STYLE:**
- Instead of: "Can you help me implement user authentication for my application?"
- Use: "ugh I'm struggling with implementing auth in my React app... any ideas on the best approach??"

- Instead of: "I am encountering an error with my database connection. How do I resolve this?"
- Use: "wtf my database connection keeps timing out and I'm getting this weird error... help??"

- Instead of: "Please review my code and provide optimization suggestions."
- Use: "can you take a look at this messy code I wrote? feels like it could be way more efficient lol"

### 11. MANDATORY COMPLEX CODE GENERATION AND SHARING
**CRITICAL: 85% of your questions MUST include substantial code snippets (20-60+ lines)**

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: Generate realistic, complex, production-level code based on bullet point technical details**

**MINIMUM CODE COMPLEXITY STANDARDS:**
- **Every code block MUST be 20-60+ lines minimum**
- **Include multiple functions/methods/classes (4-6 minimum)**
- **Add realistic imports and dependencies (3-5 minimum)**
- **Include proper error handling, validation, and edge cases**
- **Add database operations, API calls, or complex business logic**
- **Use realistic variable names, function names, and code structure**
- **Include configuration, setup, and environmental considerations**

**For debugging scenarios:**
- Generate substantial broken/buggy code with realistic, hard-to-spot errors
- Include multiple interconnected components where bugs span across them
- Add complex error scenarios: race conditions, memory issues, async problems
- "I'm getting this weird error and can't figure out what's wrong: ```[generate 25-50 lines of complex buggy code with realistic imports, multiple functions, proper structure, and subtle bugs]``` Any ideas what's causing this??"

**For code review scenarios:**
- Generate substantial working but suboptimal code with multiple improvement areas
- Include performance bottlenecks, security issues, maintainability problems
- Add architectural concerns, code smells, and scalability limitations
- "Can you review this code? It works but feels really messy and I think there are performance issues: ```[generate 30-60 lines of functional but poorly optimized code with multiple functions, realistic imports, complex logic, and clear improvement opportunities]``` How can I make it better??"

**For implementation request scenarios:**
- Generate substantial partial implementations with detailed TODO sections
- Include architectural setup, configuration, and integration points
- Add complex business logic requirements and data flow considerations
- "I'm working on this feature and have this so far: ```[generate 25-50 lines of partial implementation with realistic structure, imports, multiple functions, and clear TODO sections]``` Can you help me complete the missing parts??"

**For optimization scenarios:**
- Generate substantial working but highly inefficient code
- Include obvious performance problems, resource waste, and algorithmic issues
- Add monitoring points, caching opportunities, and scalability concerns
- "This code is working but it's super slow with large datasets: ```[generate 30-70 lines of inefficient but functional code with performance bottlenecks, multiple functions, realistic structure, and clear optimization needs]``` How can I make it faster??"

**CODE GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Match the exact technology stack mentioned in bullet points
- Create realistic code that fits the specific technical scenario described
- Include appropriate framework patterns, design principles, and best practices
- Add realistic business logic, data validation, and error handling
- Use proper code organization, meaningful comments, and documentation
- Include environment setup, configuration, and dependency management
- Add logging, monitoring, and debugging considerations where appropriate

**FORBIDDEN CODE PATTERNS:**
- Simple, tutorial-style code examples
- Single function snippets without context
- Code without realistic imports or dependencies
- Generic variable names or unrealistic structure
- Code that looks artificially created for learning
- Overly simplified examples that don't reflect real development

### 12. MANDATORY COVERAGE VERIFICATION
Before writing questions, list every technical detail from bullet points (NOTE: DO NOT generate these below in the messages):
- Technologies/frameworks mentioned: ___
- Specific errors/bugs described: ___
- Code components/functions: ___
- Implementation requirements: ___
- Technical challenges: ___
- Performance/optimization needs: ___

Then ensure each detail gets at least one question WITH SUBSTANTIAL CODE.

## CRITICAL RULES:

## CRITICAL ALERT: BULLET TYPE DETECTION
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP - CHECK EACH BULLET:**
- If bullet contains "**Time Anchor:**" → ABSOLUTELY NO CODE, ONLY project/scheduling questions
- If bullet contains "**Personal Introduction:**" → ABSOLUTELY NO CODE, ONLY career/personal questions  
- Otherwise → Technical bullet, GENERATE CODE

### 1. CURRENT FOCUS AREAS BULLET TYPE IDENTIFICATION - CHECK FIRST
**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:** Identify the bullet type in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS:
- **Time Anchor:** bullets (contain "Time Anchor:" in title) → NO CODE GENERATION
- **Personal Introduction:** bullets (contain "Personal Introduction:" in title) → NO CODE GENERATION  
- **Technical bullets:** (all others) → CODE GENERATION REQUIRED

### 2. MANDATORY DETAIL COVERAGE & TRACKING
**BEFORE GENERATING:** Extract and list EVERY SINGLE detail from CURRENT FOCUS AREAS:
- Names: [extract ALL names, developer names, company names, project names]
- Numbers/Versions: [extract ALL version numbers, dates, times, quantities, ports]
- Technologies/Frameworks: [extract ALL tech stack, languages, libraries, tools]
- File/Function Names: [extract ALL specific filenames, functions, variables, components]
- Error Messages: [extract ALL specific errors, bugs, issues mentioned]
- Technical Specifications: [extract ALL APIs, databases, configurations, requirements]
- Personal/Project Details: [extract ALL roles, goals, deadlines, project contexts]

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT:** Every single extracted detail MUST appear in at least one question across the batch.
**USAGE TRACKING:** Mark each detail as used. Verify 100% coverage before finalizing questions.

### 3. ABSOLUTE SOURCE RESTRICTION
**ONLY ALLOWED:** Details explicitly written in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS bullet points
**COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN:**
- ANY content from BATCH_HISTORY
- ANY content from CONTEXT REFERENCE sections
- Generic programming questions
- Details not explicitly mentioned in current bullets

**CONTEXT REFERENCE RULE:** Use only to understand WHAT technologies/components mean when they appear in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS.

### 4. DETAIL USAGE PATTERN (ANTI-REPETITION)
- **First mention:** Use full specific detail from bullet point (exact names, versions, error messages)
- **Subsequent references:** Use pronouns ("it", "that", "my React app", "the API")
- **VERIFICATION:** Each specific detail appears ONLY ONCE across all questions

ONLY IF bullet's title in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS is not time anchor or personal introduction

ABSOLUTE EXCEPTIONS - NO CODE GENERATION:
- **Time Anchor:** bullets - NEVER EVER generate any code, programming solutions, or technical implementations
- **Personal Introduction:** bullets - NEVER EVER generate any code, programming solutions, or technical implementations
- FOR PERSONAL INTRODUCTION BULLETS: Generate questions FROM the perspective of the person introducing themselves
The person in the bullet is the USER asking the questions
These are contextual/personal details, NOT technical coding scenarios

**STOP AND VERIFY: If the bullet contains "Time Anchor:" or "Personal Introduction:" in the title, you MUST NOT generate ANY code blocks, programming solutions, scripts, or technical implementations. Period.**

**FOR TIME ANCHOR/PERSONAL INTRODUCTION BULLETS:**
- Focus on project management, scheduling, personal goals
- Ask about deadlines, meeting coordination, project planning
- NO code blocks, NO programming solutions, NO technical implementations
- Use natural conversation about timing, goals, and context

**CODE COMPLEXITY REQUIREMENTS (for all other bullets):**
- **Minimum 20-60+ lines per code block**
- **Multiple functions/methods/classes (4-6 minimum)**
- **Realistic imports and dependencies (3-5 minimum)**
- **Proper error handling, validation, edge cases**
- **Complex business logic, database operations, API calls**
- **Production-level structure and realistic variable names**

**REQUIRED PATTERNS (for coding bullets only):**
- **Debugging (40%):** Generate buggy code with realistic, hard-to-spot errors
- **Code Review (25%):** Generate working but suboptimal code needing improvements
- **Implementation (20%):** Generate partial implementations with detailed TODOs
- **Optimization (15%):** Generate slow/inefficient but functional code

**NEVER use simple examples or tutorial-style code - always production-level complexity**

### 6. AUTHENTIC DEVELOPER STYLE
**Language:** Use contractions ("I'm", "don't"), dev slang ("lol", "btw"), fillers ("like", "um"), informal punctuation ("...", "??", "!!")
**Emotion:** Show genuine feelings - frustration with bugs, excitement about features
**Natural Flow:** Mix question lengths, include rambling, thinking out loud
**Technical Authenticity:** Include actual error messages, file names, version numbers from bullets

### 7. CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER
Process bullet points in exact order provided. Earlier bullet details appear in earlier questions.

### 8. CODING QUESTION STRATEGY
- **Implementation:** "Help me build [specific feature from bullet]"
- **Debugging:** "I'm getting this error: [specific error]. How do I fix it?"
- **Code Review:** "Can you review this [specific code] and suggest improvements?"
- **Optimization:** "How can I make [specific implementation] faster?"

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Generate exactly <SUB_BATCH_SIZE> questions that:

---MESSAGE_SEPARATOR---
[Continue for all <SUB_BATCH_SIZE> messages]
### COMPLETE ###

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**

"""

# ******************************

math_message_generation_prompt = """
You are generating realistic math questions that a USER would ask an AI ASSISTANT. Your ONLY job is to create mathematical questions based on the SPECIFIC DETAILS mentioned in the bullet points in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS below.

## CURRENT FOCUS AREAS (STRICT SCOPE - ONLY SOURCE FOR QUESTIONS):
<FOCUSED_BULLETS>

## QUESTIONS ALREADY COVERED IN THIS BATCH (AVOID THESE):
<BATCH_HISTORY>

## CURRENT BATCH CONTEXT (AWARENESS ONLY - DO NOT GENERATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS):
<PREVIOUS_SUB_BATCH_PLANS>

## PREVIOUS BATCH PLANS [LEARNING REFERENCE DATABASE] (REFERENCE ONLY & AWARENESS ONLY - DO NOT GENERATE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS):
<PREVIOUS_BATCH_PLANS>

CRITICAL: These sections provide REFERENCE INFORMATION to help you understand mathematical context, previous learning, concept progression, and problem-solving evolution mentioned in the current bullet points in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS. Use this information to understand WHAT has been learned, WHICH concepts are being studied, and WHAT previous mathematical work happened, but NEVER generate questions directly about topics from these reference sections.

---

## CRITICAL RULES:

### 1. ABSOLUTE BULLET-POINT IN CURRENT FOCUS AREAS BOUNDARY RULE
**CRITICAL: Mention all the details in the given CURRENT FOCUS AREAS (numbers, names, dates, mathematical detail, problem, concept, or learning situation mentioned) at least once accross the questions you generate.**

### 2. BULLET-POINT IN CURRENT FOCUS AREAS EXTRACTION RULE
- Read each bullet point in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS word by word
- Identify EVERY specific mathematical detail, problem, concept, or learning situation mentioned
- Create questions ONLY about these extracted mathematical elements
- IGNORE the general mathematical topic/theme - focus solely on bullet point specifics

**STRICT VERIFICATION CHECKLIST** - Before each question, ask:
1. Is this exact detail explicitly mentioned in a current bullet point in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS?
2. Am I expanding beyond what's written?
3. Am I asking about the specific situation/emotion/action described?
4. Am I staying within the precise scope of what's mentioned?

**ALLOWED**: Questions about the exact words, phrases, mathematical detail, problem, concept, or learning situation written in bullets in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS

### 3. FORBIDDEN EXPANSION
- Do NOT ask about the broader mathematical topic (calculus in general, etc.)
- Do NOT ask generic questions about the mathematical field
- Do NOT add mathematical information not mentioned in the bullet points in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS
- Do NOT create educational questions about mathematical concepts beyond what's specified
- ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Do NOT generate questions directly about topics from reference sections
- Use reference info only to understand context for current bullet points in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS

### 4. DETAIL ESTABLISHMENT & REFERENCE RULE - **ANTI-REPETITION PRIORITY**
**CRITICAL: Mention specific details from bullet points in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS ONLY ONCE, then use natural references**

**DETAIL USAGE PATTERN:**
- **First mention**: Include full specific details from bullet point in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS
- **All subsequent questions**: Use pronouns, references, or contextual shortcuts
- **Natural progression**: Questions evolve from establishing details to exploring implications

### 5. CURRENT FOCUS AREAS BULLET-POINT in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS EXTRACTION RULE
- Read each bullet point in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS word by word
- Identify EVERY mathematical detail, problem, concept, or fact mentioned
- Create questions ONLY about these extracted elements
- IGNORE the general topic/theme - focus solely on bullet point in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS specifics
- NEVER infer or add information not explicitly stated

### 6. REFERENCE DATABASE USAGE
- Use "CURRENT BATCH CONTEXT" and "LEARNING REFERENCE DATABASE" to understand mathematical references in current bullet points
- If current bullets mention a theorem/concept without context, check reference sections to understand what it covers
- If current bullets mention a problem type without context, check reference sections to understand the approach
- If current bullets reference past mathematical work, use reference sections to understand what was learned
- **KEY**: Use reference info to UNDERSTAND current bullets in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS, but generate questions ONLY about current bullet content

### 7. MATHEMATICAL QUESTION GENERATION STRATEGY
For each specific mathematical element in the bullet points in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS, create questions that follow these patterns:

**PROBLEM-SOLVING REQUESTS:**
- "Help me solve [specific problem from bullet]"
- "I need to find [specific mathematical task from bullet]"
- "Show me how to [specific calculation/proof from bullet]"
- "I'm stuck on [specific problem element from bullet]"

**CONCEPT CLARIFICATION:**
- "I don't understand [specific concept from bullet]"
- "Can you explain why [specific mathematical statement from bullet]?"
- "What does [specific term/definition from bullet] mean?"
- "How does [specific concept from bullet] work?"

**SOLUTION VERIFICATION:**
- "Can you check if my solution to [specific problem from bullet] is correct?"
- "Is my approach to [specific problem from bullet] right?"
- "Did I solve [specific equation/problem from bullet] correctly?"
- "Can you verify my work on [specific calculation from bullet]?"

**METHOD EXPLANATION:**
- "Why does [specific method from bullet] work for this problem?"
- "Show me step-by-step how to [specific procedure from bullet]"
- "Explain the reasoning behind [specific solution approach from bullet]"
- "What's the logic of [specific mathematical technique from bullet]?"

### 8. CHRONOLOGICAL ORDERING RULE
- Process bullet points in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS in the exact order provided
- Questions must follow the chronological sequence of the bullet points in CURRENT FOCUS AREAS
- Earlier bullet point details should appear in earlier questions
- Later bullet point details should appear in later questions

### 9. LEARNING CONTEXT HANDLING
- DO NOT include learning introductions in questions unless it's the very first batch of the entire conversation series
- Assume the AI assistant already knows the learning context from previous conversations
- Jump straight into the mathematical question without re-introducing the course/topic
- Reference mathematical concepts naturally without formal introduction: "this derivative", "the quadratic equation we're working on", "my calculus homework", etc.

### 10. TEMPORAL ANCHOR HANDLING
- If bullet points mention specific learning times (deadlines, exams, "next class", "recently learned", etc.), incorporate that timing naturally into questions
- Do NOT mention the label name "temporal anchor" or reference it explicitly
- Use the timing context naturally: "I have a test tomorrow..." or "Since we just learned..." or "I need to finish this homework..."

### 11. AUTHENTIC USER CONVERSATION STYLE
**CRITICAL: These must sound like REAL USERS texting/chatting, not formal academic writing.**

**Language Authenticity:**
- Use lots of contractions: "I'm", "don't", "can't", "it's", "that's", "won't"
- Include casual user slang: "lol", "btw", "tbh", "kinda", "sorta", "gonna", "wanna"
- Add filler words: "like", "um", "you know", "I mean", "so", "well"
- Use informal punctuation: multiple periods "...", question marks "??", exclamation points "!!"

**Mathematical Authenticity:**
- Include actual problem statements when mentioned in bullets
- Reference specific equation types, theorem names, mathematical procedures from bullets
- Use realistic mathematical scenarios that users actually encounter
- Include course names, textbook references, assignment details when mentioned

**Imperfect Natural Speech:**
- Include minor typos and informal grammar
- Use incomplete thoughts: "so I was trying to..." or "not sure if this makes sense but..."
- Add rambling elements: "I mean, I guess what I'm trying to solve is..."
- Include thinking out loud: "hmm", "wait", "actually", "oh", "maybe"

**Emotional Authenticity:**
- Show genuine user feelings: frustration with problems, confusion about concepts, excitement about understanding
- Use emotional language: "I'm so confused by this problem", "this equation is driving me crazy", "I finally get derivatives!"
- Add personal reactions: "ugh", "omg", "yay", "oof", "wtf", "help!"

**Varied Question Structures:**
- Mix short and long questions
- Some incomplete questions: "so about that integration thing..."
- Some statements that imply questions: "not sure what I did wrong here..."
- Avoid repetitive "Can you help me..." or "How do I..." patterns

**Natural User Flow Patterns:**
- Start some questions mid-thought about problems
- Include context rambling before getting to the mathematical point
- Add uncertainty markers: "maybe", "I think", "I'm not sure but", "does that make sense?"
- Use conversational bridges: "oh and also", "btw", "speaking of which", "another thing"

**EXAMPLES OF AUTHENTIC USER STYLE:**
- Instead of: "Can you help me solve this quadratic equation?"
- Use: "ugh I'm stuck on this quadratic equation and I have no idea which method to use... help??"

- Instead of: "I am having difficulty understanding the concept of limits."
- Use: "wtf are limits supposed to mean?? I keep reading the definition but it makes no sense..."

- Instead of: "Please review my solution and provide feedback."
- Use: "can you check if I did this derivative right? feels like I messed up somewhere lol"

### 12. MATHEMATICAL WORK GENERATION AND REALISTIC BEHAVIOR PATTERNS
**CRITICAL: All mathematical work must follow realistic human behavior patterns**

**MANDATORY REALISTIC PATTERNS - CHOOSE ONE PER QUESTION:**

**Pattern A: Completely Stuck (40% of questions)**
- Express complete confusion about the problem or concept
- Ask for help with approach, method selection, or starting point
- Show NO mathematical work - just describe what you're trying to solve

**Pattern B: Partially Stuck (30% of questions)**
- Show ONLY the initial steps where you attempted the problem (2-4 lines maximum)
- Clearly indicate where you got confused or stuck
- Ask for help with the specific next step or continuation
- Stop showing work at the point of confusion

**Pattern C: Need Verification (20% of questions)**

You are role-playing as a real user having an authentic conversation with an AI chat assistant. 
The AI assistant has just asked you a question, and you need to provide a natural, human-like response.

#### Input Context You'll Receive:
- **Current Batch Message History**: The conversation flow leading to the AI's question
- **Topic & Theme**: The main subject of this conversation
- **Previous Plans**: Summary of earlier conversation contexts for continuity
- **Current Plan**: The overarching narrative direction for this conversation batch
- **AI's Question**: The specific question the assistant asked that requires your response

#### INPUTS:
**Current Batch Message History**: <current_batch_messages>
**Topic**: <topic>
**Theme**: <theme>
**Previous Plans Summary**: <previous_plans_summary>
**Previous Batches of This Plan**: <previous_batches> 
**Current Plan**: <current_plan>
**AI's Question**: <ai_last_message>

#### CRITICAL: Keep Responses SHORT and Natural
**Real users give brief, to-the-point answers to AI questions**

#### Your Role & Behavior:
You are a real human user with:
- Personal experiences, opinions, and emotions
- Natural speech patterns and conversational habits
- Realistic knowledge limitations and curiosity
- Consistent personality traits across the conversation

**Language Authenticity:**
- Use lots of contractions: "I'm", "don't", "can't", "it's", "that's"
- Include casual slang: "lol", "btw", "tbh", "kinda", "sorta", "gonna", "wanna"
- Add filler words: "like", "um", "you know", "I mean", "so", "well"
- Use informal punctuation: multiple periods "...", question marks "??", exclamation points "!!"

**Imperfect Natural Speech:**
- Include minor typos and informal grammar
- Add rambling elements: "I mean, ..."
- Include thinking out loud: "hmm", "actually", "oh", "maybe"

**Emotional Authenticity:**
- Show genuine feelings: excitement, frustration, uncertainty, hope
- Use emotional language
- Add personal reactions: "ugh", "omg", "yay", "oof", "blah"

#### Response Guidelines:

**STEP 1 - Check Plans for Existing Information**:
- **First**, carefully review the Current Plan and Previous Plans for any information that answers the AI's question
- **If found in plans**: Base your response on that established information to maintain story continuity
- **If not found in plans**: Create a new answer that aligns with the topic, theme, and existing storyline

**STEP 2 - Answer the AI's Question Directly**:
- Keep your reply focused on answering; do **not** introduce new questions.  
- Give a direct answer to what the AI asked
- Don't over-explain or provide unnecessary details
- Answer like you would in a real text conversation
- Include personal context or examples when natural
- **CRITICAL**: Ensure your answer doesn't contradict anything established in previous or current plans

**Stay Consistent with Context**:
- Maintain the same personality and circumstances throughout
- Keep your responses aligned with the current topic and theme

**Response Characteristics**:
- **Tone**: Match the conversation's emotional tone and your established personality
- **Authenticity**: Sound like a real person, not an AI trying to sound human

#### Critical Instructions:
- **Be concise** - Real people don't write long in chat
- Keep your reply focused on answering; do **not** introduce new questions.  
- **ALWAYS check plans first** - Look for any information that answers the AI's question before creating new details
- **Maintain consistency** - Never contradict information established in current or previous plans
- **Fill gaps naturally** - If plans don't have the answer, create responses that fit the established storyline
- ONLY provide your response as the user - no meta-commentary
- Stay in character as a human user throughout
- Answer the question but don't feel obligated to ask a question back (the AI asked YOU)

CRITICAL NOTE: Respond only in English. Do not include any Chinese.
"""

user_llm_ask_followup_question_template = """
You must respond **only in English**. Do not include any Chinese characters or phrases in your response.
You are a real person having a conversation with an AI assistant. Based on the conversation history and the AI's last response, ask ONE natural follow-up question.

## CONTEXT:
**Current Batch Message History**: <current_batch_messages>
**Topic**: <topic>
**Theme**: <theme>
**Previous Plans Summary**: <previous_plans_summary>
**Previous Batches of This Plan**: <previous_batches>
**Current Plan**: <current_plan>
**AI's Response**: <ai_last_message>

## YOUR TASK
Ask a follow-up question (10-20 words) that a real person would naturally ask after receiving the AI's response.

## CRITICAL RULES TO PREVENT REPETITION

Before generating your question:
1. **Scan the Current Batch Message History** for all topics already discussed
2. **Check Previous Batches** for questions already asked
3. **Never ask about something already covered**

If you notice your question seeks information already provided in the conversation history, STOP and generate a completely different question.

## HOW REAL PEOPLE ASK FOLLOW-UPS

### Natural conversation starters:
- "oh wait..." / "hmm..." / "actually..." / "btw..." / "ok but..."
- "that's cool but..." / "makes sense, though..." / "yeah but what about..."

### Authentic reaction patterns:

**Building on the last ai response:**
- Ask about a specific topic not yet covered
- Connect it to your personal situation from the Current Plan

**Showing genuine reactions:**
- If AI gave good news → "nice! but does that mean..."
- If AI mentioned a challenge → "ugh ok, so how do I..."
- If AI explained something → "got it, but what if..."
- If AI suggested options → "hmm which one works better for..."

### Question types that feel natural:
- **Practical concerns**: "how long does that usually take?"
- **Personal application**: "would that work even if I..."
- **Clarification**: "wait so you're saying I should..."
- **Next steps**: "ok cool, do I need to..."
- **Specific worries**: "what happens if..."

## NATURAL SPEECH PATTERNS

Include these elements to sound human:
- Contractions: "don't", "can't", "won't", "that's"
- Casual words: "kinda", "sorta", "gonna", "like"
- Emotional reactions: "ugh", "hmm", "oh", "yikes"
- Informal punctuation: "..." or "??" or "!"

## CONVERSATION FLOW AWARENESS

Based on where you are in the Current Batch Message History:
Ask broader exploratory questions
Ask for specific details or comparisons  
Ask about implementation or next steps

## AUTHENTICITY CHECKLIST

Your question should:
✓ Reference something from the AI's LAST response
✓ NOT repeat any topic from message history
✓ Sound like casual conversation, not an interview
✓ Be 10-20 words maximum
✓ Include at least one casual element (contraction, filler word, etc.)

CRITICAL NOTE: Respond only in English. Do not include any Chinese.

## YOUR RESPONSE:
[Generate only the follow-up question, nothing else]

# ================================ topic generation ================================

ten_m_generate_following_topics = """
You are a narrative coherence specialist creating CHRONOLOGICALLY SEQUENCED topic clusters for realistic conversational AI dataset generation. Your task is to generate 10 interconnected topics that form a natural life progression.

## INPUT DATA
- **SEED TOPIC**: <seed_topic>
- **SEED THEME**: <seed_theme>  
- **SEED SUBTOPICS**: <seed_subtopics>
- **USER PROFILE**: <user_profile>
- **TIMELINE**: <timeline>

## CORE OBJECTIVE
Generate a JSON object containing 10 topics (including the provided seed topic as Topic 0) that form a CHRONOLOGICALLY COHERENT narrative where each topic naturally follows the previous one in realistic time progression.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. CHRONOLOGICAL COHERENCE & TOPIC INDEPENDENCE

**TOPIC PROGRESSION RULES:**
- **Topic 0**: Use the provided seed topic EXACTLY as given
- **Topics 1-9**: Each must be a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT life domain/category
- **NO EXTENDED NARRATIVES**: Topics 1-9 should NOT continue the seed topic's story
- **LIFE PROGRESSION**: Each topic represents what naturally happens AFTER completing the previous life experience

**TOPIC INDEPENDENCE MANDATE:**
- Each topic must address a DIFFERENT life area (career, relationships, health, education, finances, etc.)
- Topics should show how one life experience leads to growth in OTHER areas
- NO topic should be "Part 2" of a previous topic

### 2. NATURAL LIFE FLOW REQUIREMENTS

**CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS WITHOUT CONTINUATION:**
- Topic N+1 is INFLUENCED BY Topic N but addresses a DIFFERENT life domain
- Show how growth in one area catalyzes change in another area
- Example: Travel experience (Topic 0) → Career reassessment (Topic 1) → Relationship priorities (Topic 2)

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS:**
Multiple topics about the same event/project
"Before/During/After" sequences for the same activity
Topics that could be subtopics of each other
Repetitive categories or themes

**REQUIRED PATTERNS:**
Each topic = New life challenge/opportunity
Different category for each topic
Natural cause-and-effect across different life domains
Holistic life progression showing multi-dimensional growth

### 3. USER PROFILE ALIGNMENT
- **Demographic Consistency**: All topics must align with user's age, education, career level, and life stage
- **Financial Realism**: Topics must reflect user's actual financial capacity and constraints
- **Geographic Logic**: Topics must consider user's location and mobility constraints
- **Value Alignment**: Topics must reflect user's stated priorities, interests, and life goals

### 4. TOPIC BREADTH REQUIREMENTS
Each topic must include a realistic timeline that:
- **Sequential Timing**: Topics must not overlap and should follow logical temporal progression
- **Duration Realism**: Each topic should span 1-2 months for authentic decision-making and implementation
- **Natural Gaps**: Include realistic time gaps between major life transitions
- **Seasonal Considerations**: Account for natural timing (job searches, moving seasons, academic calendars)
- **Timeline Format**: Use "Month X, Year Y - Month X', Year Y'" format
Each topic must be sufficiently BROAD to generate 2000+ authentic conversations by including:
- **Multiple Decision Points**: 15-20 major decisions per topic
- **Complex Subtopics**: 9-10 substantial subtopics that each require extensive discussion
- **Ongoing Processes**: Topics involving multi-month planning, execution, and adjustment phases
- **Cross-Domain Impact**: Topics affecting multiple life areas

### 5. NARRATIVE REALISM
- **Natural Timing**: Realistic time gaps between major life decisions
- **Emotional Progression**: Topics should reflect natural emotional and psychological development
- **Practical Constraints**: Topics must acknowledge real-world limitations (money, time, responsibilities)

## OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

Generate a single JSON object with this EXACT structure:

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "category": "[Provided Category]",
      "title": "[Provided Title]", 
      "theme": "[Provided Theme]",
      "subtopics": [/* Provided Subtopics Array */],
      "timeline": "[Start Month, Year - End Month, Year]"

      "timeline": "[Start Month, Year - End Month, Year]"
    },
    // ... topics 2-9 following same structure
  ]
}
```

## CRITICAL TIMELINE REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY NON-OVERLAPPING TIMELINE RULES

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Each topic's timeline MUST start AT LEAST one month AFTER the previous topic ends.

**TIMELINE CALCULATION PROTOCOL:**
1. Topic 0: Uses provided timeline exactly
2. Topic N+1 start = Topic N end + AT LEAST 1 month gap
3. NO overlapping months between any topics
4. Each topic duration: 1-2 months

**EXAMPLE PROGRESSION (REQUIRED FORMAT):**
- Topic 0: "January 2015 - February 2015" (ends February)
- Topic 1: "April 2015 - May 2015" (starts April, NOT March - includes gap)
- Topic 2: "July 2015 - September 2015" (starts July - includes gap)
- Topic 3: "November 2016 - January 2016" (starts November - includes gap)

**FORBIDDEN TIMELINE PATTERNS:**
Topic 1 ends "Month x Year y", Topic 2 starts "Month x Year y" (OVERLAP)
Topic 1 ends "Month x Year y", Topic 2 starts "Month x+1 Year y" (NO GAP)
Any shared months between topics
Immediate month-to-month transitions

**REQUIRED TIMELINE PATTERNS:**
Minimum 1-month gap between all topics
Clear temporal separation showing life progression
Realistic pauses between major life decisions

**TIMELINE VERIFICATION STEPS:**
Before finalizing each topic:
1. Identify previous topic's END month
2. Add AT LEAST 1 month to get earliest possible START
3. Verify NO month appears in multiple topics
4. Confirm realistic gaps for life transitions

**GAP JUSTIFICATION:**
The 1+ month gaps represent:
- Processing and integration time after major experiences
- Natural life rhythms and decision-making periods
- Realistic pacing of significant life changes
- Time for consequences of previous decisions to manifest

## TOPIC PROGRESSION GUIDELINES

### Phase 1: Post-Seed Topic Reality (Topics 1-2)
- **Topic 1**: How the seed topic experience changes perspective on ANOTHER life area
- **Topic 2**: Ripple effects creating needs in YET ANOTHER domain

### Phase 2: Multi-Domain Growth (Topics 3-5)
- **Topics 3-5**: Leveraging cumulative growth to address diverse life challenges

### Phase 3: Integration Across Life (Topics 6-8)
- **Topics 6-8**: Synthesizing learnings to optimize different life areas

### Phase 4: Holistic Vision (Topic 9)
- **Topic 9**: Long-term life design incorporating all previous growth

**CRITICAL QUESTION FOR EACH TOPIC:**
"After completing [previous topic], what DIFFERENT area of life would this person naturally need to address next?"

## QUALITY VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing each topic, verify:

### Chronological Logic
- [ ] Could this topic realistically happen AFTER the previous topic?
- [ ] Are there clear causal connections to previous topics?
- [ ] Does the content logically flow from previous experiences?

### User Profile Compatibility  
- [ ] Does this align with the user's age and life stage?
- [ ] Is this financially realistic given the user's situation?
- [ ] Is this geographically feasible for the user?

### Conversation Generation Potential
- [ ] Does this topic contain 15+ major decision points?
- [ ] Are the subtopics broad enough for extensive discussion?
- [ ] Would this topic naturally generate 2000+ authentic questions?
- [ ] Are there multiple stakeholders and perspectives involved?

### Narrative Coherence
- [ ] Does this topic build upon character growth from previous topics?
- [ ] Are there clear references/connections to earlier experiences?
- [ ] Does this topic push character development forward?
- [ ] Is the emotional/psychological progression realistic?

**TOPIC DIVERSITY CHECKLIST:**
Before finalizing each topic:
- [ ] Is this a completely different category from previous topics?
- [ ] Does it address a new life domain?
- [ ] Is it influenced by, but not a continuation of, the previous topic?
- [ ] Would this naturally be the next life priority after the previous experience?
- [ ] Does it show growth applied to a DIFFERENT area of life?

## EXAMPLE PROGRESSION LOGIC

Each topic should answer: "Given what happened in the previous topic, what would logically be the next major life area this person needs to address?"

## FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS
- **Non-sequential topics**: Topics that could happen in any order
- **Profile contradictions**: Topics that contradict user's established circumstances
- **Unrealistic jumps**: Major life changes without proper foundation/motivation
- **Narrow topics**: Topics that couldn't generate extensive conversation
- **Template responses**: Generic topics that don't reflect unique user circumstances

## EXECUTION NOTES
- Generate all 10 topics in a single coherent response
- Ensure seamless narrative flow from Topic 0 through Topic 9
- Prioritize realism and character consistency over dramatic storylines
- Focus on authentic life progressions that real people experience
- End output immediately after closing the JSON structure

**CRITICAL**: Output your response in JSON format only. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or additional commentary. Provide only the raw JSON object.

## CRITICAL TIMELINE REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY NON-OVERLAPPING TIMELINE RULES

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Each topic's timeline MUST start AT LEAST one month AFTER the previous topic ends.

**TIMELINE CALCULATION PROTOCOL:**
1. Topic 0: Uses provided timeline exactly
2. Topic N+1 start = Topic N end + AT LEAST 1 month gap
3. NO overlapping months between any topics
4. Each topic duration: 1-2 months

**EXAMPLE PROGRESSION (REQUIRED FORMAT):**
- Topic 0: "January 2015 - February 2015" (ends February)
- Topic 1: "April 2015 - May 2015" (starts April, NOT March - includes gap)
- Topic 2: "July 2015 - September 2015" (starts July - includes gap)
- Topic 3: "November 2015 - January 2016" (starts November - includes gap)

**FORBIDDEN TIMELINE PATTERNS:**
Topic 1 ends "Month x Year y", Topic 2 starts "Month x Year y" (OVERLAP)
Topic 1 ends "Month x Year y", Topic 2 starts "Month x+1 Year y" (NO GAP)
Any shared months between topics
Immediate month-to-month transitions

**REQUIRED TIMELINE PATTERNS:**
Minimum 1-month gap between all topics
Clear temporal separation showing technical progression
Realistic pauses between major technical learning phases

**TIMELINE VERIFICATION STEPS:**
Before finalizing each topic:
1. Identify previous topic's END month
2. Add AT LEAST 1 month to get earliest possible START
3. Verify NO month appears in multiple topics
4. Confirm realistic gaps for technical transitions

**GAP JUSTIFICATION:**
The 1+ month gaps represent:
- Processing and integration time after major technical experiences
- Natural learning rhythms and skill consolidation periods
- Realistic pacing of significant technical skill development
- Time for consequences of previous technical decisions to manifest

## TOPIC PROGRESSION GUIDELINES

- **Topics 2-3**: Leveraging cumulative technical growth to address diverse coding challenges

### Phase 3: Technical Integration Across Domains (Topic 4)
- **Topic 4**: Synthesizing technical learnings to optimize different coding areas and establish long-term technical vision

**CRITICAL QUESTION FOR EACH TOPIC:**
"After completing [previous coding topic], what DIFFERENT technical area would this developer naturally need to address next?"

## QUALITY VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing each topic, verify:

### Chronological Logic
- [ ] Could this topic realistically happen AFTER the previous coding topic?

**TECHNICAL DIVERSITY CHECKLIST:**
Before finalizing each topic:
- [ ] Is this a completely different coding category from previous topics?
- [ ] Does it address a new technical domain?
- [ ] Is it influenced by, but not a continuation of, the previous topic?
- [ ] Would this naturally be the next technical priority after the previous experience?
- [ ] Does it show technical growth applied to a DIFFERENT coding area?

## EXAMPLE PROGRESSION LOGIC

Each topic should answer: "Given what was learned/built in the previous topic, what DIFFERENT technical area would this developer naturally need to explore next?"

## FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS
- **Non-sequential topics**: Topics that could happen in any order
- **Profile contradictions**: Topics that contradict user's established technical level
- **Unrealistic jumps**: Major technical changes without proper foundation/motivation
- **Narrow topics**: Topics that couldn't generate extensive technical conversation
- **Template responses**: Generic topics that don't reflect unique developer circumstances

## EXECUTION NOTES
- Generate all 5 topics in a single coherent response
- Ensure seamless technical narrative flow from Topic 0 through Topic 4
- Prioritize technical realism and skill consistency over dramatic storylines

  "topics": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "category": "[Provided Category]",
      "title": "[Provided Title]", 
      "theme": "[Provided Theme]",

      "timeline": "[Start Month, Year - End Month, Year]"
    },
    // ... topics 2-9 following same structure
  ]
}
```

## CRITICAL TIMELINE REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY NON-OVERLAPPING TIMELINE RULES

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Each topic's timeline MUST start AT LEAST one month AFTER the previous topic ends.

**TIMELINE CALCULATION PROTOCOL:**
1. Topic 0: Uses provided timeline exactly
2. Topic N+1 start = Topic N end + AT LEAST 1 month gap
3. NO overlapping months between any topics
4. Each topic duration: 1-2 months

**EXAMPLE PROGRESSION (REQUIRED FORMAT):**
- Topic 0: "January 2015 - February 2015" (ends February)
- Topic 1: "April 2015 - May 2015" (starts April, NOT March - includes gap)
- Topic 2: "July 2015 - September 2015" (starts July - includes gap)
- Topic 3: "November 2015 - January 2016" (starts November - includes gap)
- Topic 4: "March 2016 - April 2016" (starts March - includes gap)
- Topic 5: "June 2016 - July 2016" (starts June - includes gap)
- Topic 6: "September 2016 - October 2016" (starts September - includes gap)
- Topic 7: "December 2016 - January 2017" (starts December - includes gap)
- Topic 8: "March 2017 - April 2017" (starts March - includes gap)
- Topic 9: "June 2017 - August 2017" (starts June - includes gap)

**FORBIDDEN TIMELINE PATTERNS:**
Topic 1 ends "Month x Year y", Topic 2 starts "Month x Year y" (OVERLAP)
Topic 1 ends "Month x Year y", Topic 2 starts "Month x+1 Year y" (NO GAP)
Any shared months between topics
Immediate month-to-month transitions

**REQUIRED TIMELINE PATTERNS:**
Minimum 1-month gap between all topics
Clear temporal separation showing mathematical progression
Realistic pauses between major mathematical learning phases

**TIMELINE VERIFICATION STEPS:**
Before finalizing each topic:
1. Identify previous topic's END month
2. Add AT LEAST 1 month to get earliest possible START
3. Verify NO month appears in multiple topics
4. Confirm realistic gaps for mathematical transitions

**GAP JUSTIFICATION:**
The 1+ month gaps represent:
- Processing and integration time after major mathematical experiences
- Natural learning rhythms and concept consolidation periods
- Realistic pacing of significant mathematical skill development
- Time for consequences of previous mathematical decisions to manifest

## TOPIC PROGRESSION GUIDELINES

### Phase 1: Post-Seed Topic Mathematical Reality (Topics 1-2)
- **Topic 1**: How the seed topic experience changes perspective on ANOTHER mathematical area
- **Topic 2**: Leveraging initial mathematical growth to explore complementary domain

### Phase 2: Mid-Journey Mathematical Expansion (Topics 3-5)
- **Topics 3-5**: Building diverse mathematical competencies across multiple mathematical domains

### Phase 3: Advanced Mathematical Integration (Topics 6-8)
- **Topics 6-8**: Synthesizing accumulated knowledge to tackle complex cross-domain mathematical challenges

### Phase 4: Mathematical Mastery and Vision (Topic 9)
- **Topic 9**: Establishing long-term mathematical vision and theoretical leadership across domains

**CRITICAL QUESTION FOR EACH TOPIC:**
"After completing [previous mathematical topic], what DIFFERENT mathematical area would this student naturally need to explore next?"

## QUALITY VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing each topic, verify:

### Chronological Logic
- [ ] Could this topic realistically happen AFTER the previous mathematical topic?
- [ ] Are there clear mathematical connections to previous topics?
- [ ] Does the content logically flow from previous mathematical experiences?

### User Profile Compatibility  
- [ ] Does this align with the user's mathematical skill level and background?
- [ ] Is this mathematically realistic given the user's education level?
- [ ] Is this feasible given the user's academic schedule and prerequisites?

### Conversation Generation Potential
- [ ] Does this topic contain 15+ major mathematical decision points?
- [ ] Are the subtopics broad enough for extensive mathematical discussion?
- [ ] Would this topic naturally generate 2000+ authentic mathematical questions?
- [ ] Are there multiple mathematical perspectives and approaches involved?

### Mathematical Coherence
- [ ] Does this topic build upon mathematical growth from previous topics?
- [ ] Are there clear references/connections to earlier mathematical experiences?
- [ ] Does this topic push mathematical development forward?
- [ ] Is the skill/knowledge progression mathematically realistic?

**MATHEMATICAL DIVERSITY CHECKLIST:**
Before finalizing each topic:
- [ ] Is this a completely different mathematical category from previous topics?
- [ ] Does it address a new mathematical domain?
- [ ] Is it influenced by, but not a continuation of, the previous topic?
- [ ] Would this naturally be the next mathematical priority after the previous experience?
- [ ] Does it show mathematical growth applied to a DIFFERENT mathematical area?

## EXAMPLE PROGRESSION LOGIC

Each topic should answer: "Given what was learned/mastered in the previous topic, what DIFFERENT mathematical area would this student naturally need to explore next?"

## FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS
- **Non-sequential topics**: Topics that could happen in any order
- **Profile contradictions**: Topics that contradict user's established mathematical level
- **Unrealistic jumps**: Major mathematical changes without proper foundation/prerequisites
- **Narrow topics**: Topics that couldn't generate extensive mathematical conversation
- **Template responses**: Generic topics that don't reflect unique student circumstances

## EXECUTION NOTES
- Generate all 10 topics in a single coherent response
- Ensure seamless mathematical narrative flow from Topic 0 through Topic 9
- Prioritize mathematical realism and skill consistency over dramatic storylines
- Focus on authentic mathematical progressions that real students experience
- End output immediately after closing the JSON structure

**CRITICAL**: Output your response in JSON format only. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or additional commentary. Provide only the raw JSON object.

# ================================ plan generation ================================

ten_m_following_plan_generation_prompt = """
You are a long-form narrative planning specialist creating a COHERENT STORY PLANSET for natural conversational flow. Your task is to generate detailed batch plans that will seed realistic user-assistant dialogue.

## INPUT DATA
- **TOPIC:** <topic>
- **THEME:** <theme>
- **TIMELINE:** <timeline>
- **NUM_BATCHES:** <num_batches> batches
- **LABELS:** <provided_labels>
- **USER PROFILE:** <user_profile>
- **CORE RELATIONSHIPS:** <core_relationships>
- **NEW RELATIONSHIPS:** <new_relationships>
- **PREVIOUS PLAN:** <previous_plan>
- **INCLUDE_INTRODUCTION:** <YES/NO>

═══════════════ CORE OBJECTIVE ═══════════════
Generate <num_batches> distinct, non-repetitive batch plans that form a coherent narrative arc where a real person naturally converses with an AI assistant. Each plan must introduce NEW story elements while maintaining perfect continuity and character consistency.

═══════════════ NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK ═══════════════
This is NOT about generating random conversations - this is about creating a realistic, evolving story where:
- The user naturally seeks AI assistance across different life situations
- Each conversation builds upon previous interactions and established context
- The story progresses chronologically with authentic character development
- Relationships, situations, and circumstances evolve realistically over time
- The user's needs, challenges, and interests naturally expand and deepen

═══════════════ CRITICAL NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE ═══════════════
**MANDATORY FIRST-PERSON PERSPECTIVE:**
- ALL content must be written from the USER's perspective (first-person)
- Use first-person perspective throughout but VARY sentence structures
- Natural narrative flow - avoid starting every bullet with "I"
- Mix active and passive voice while maintaining first-person perspective

═══════════════ CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════
**CRITICAL**: If PREVIOUS PLAN is provided, you MUST:
- **Reference Previous Events**: Include specific callbacks to events, decisions, and outcomes from the previous plan
- **Maintain Core Character Consistency**: Keep USER PROFILE and CORE RELATIONSHIPS names and details exactly the same
- **Integrate New Relationships**: Naturally introduce NEW RELATIONSHIPS as appropriate to the current topic and timeline
- **Show Temporal Progression**: Demonstrate clear time advancement from the previous plan's timeline
- **Build Upon Previous Decisions**: Show consequences and follow-up actions from previous plan choices
- **Preserve Established Facts**: Keep all previously mentioned numbers, dates, locations, and core relationship details consistent
- **Continue Relationship Arcs**: Show evolution of existing relationships while adding new ones organically

═══════════════ STRICT TIMELINE ENFORCEMENT ═══════════════
**CRITICAL TIMELINE PARSING (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):**

Before generating ANY content, you MUST internally calculate timeline boundaries.

**STEP 1: Extract and Write Timeline Boundaries**
Parse TIMELINE to identify:
- **TIMELINE START**: [Extract exact date, e.g., "May 1, 2024"]
- **TIMELINE END**: [Extract exact date, e.g., "June 30, 2024"]
- **TOTAL DAYS**: [Calculate exact number of days]

**CALCULATE YOUR PARSED DATES:**
- Timeline Start Date: ________________
- Timeline End Date: ________________
- Total Days Available: ________________

**STEP 2: Create Batch Date Assignments**
Divide timeline into <num_batches> segments:
- Days per batch = TOTAL DAYS ÷ <num_batches>
- Batch 1 covers: Day 1 to Day [X]
- Batch 2 covers: Day [X+1] to Day [Y]
- Continue for all batches...

**CRITICAL**: Do these calculations INTERNALLY. Do NOT write them in your output.

**ABSOLUTE TIMELINE RULES:**
1. **EVERY date mentioned MUST be between START and END dates**
2. **NO future references beyond TIMELINE END** (no "next month" if timeline ends this month)
3. **NO past references before TIMELINE START**
4. **Temporal anchors MUST progress chronologically within boundaries**
5. **Final batch MUST conclude naturally before or on END DATE**

**TEMPORAL ANCHOR REQUIREMENTS:**
- First bullet of EACH batch MUST be temporal anchor
- Format: "• **Temporal Anchor:** [Month] [Day], [year], [event description]"
- Each temporal anchor date MUST be within that batch's assigned date range
- Dates must progress: Batch 2's date > Batch 1's date, etc.

**TIMELINE VIOLATION EXAMPLES (FORBIDDEN):**
Timeline is "May-June" but mentioning "July plans"
Timeline is "May-June" but saying "next month" in late June
Timeline starts May 1 but referencing "last month's meeting"
Any date outside the [START DATE] to [END DATE] range

**PRE-GENERATION CHECKLIST:**
Before writing each batch, verify:
- [ ] Have I identified my assigned date range for this batch?
- [ ] Is my temporal anchor within this range?
- [ ] Do all time references respect timeline boundaries?
- [ ] Have I avoided any dates outside [START, END]?
- [ ] Does the narrative flow naturally within constraints?

**ENFORCEMENT**: If your timeline is "May - June 2024", then:
- Batch 1 might use May 3
- Batch 5 might use May 28 
- Batch 10 might use June 25
- But NEVER July 1 or April 30

═══════════════ CRITICAL DETAIL REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════
**MANDATORY SPECIFIC DETAILS:**
Every batch MUST include numerous concrete, verifiable details that enable single-word or short factual answers:

**Required Detail Categories (minimum 5-7 per batch):**
- **Exact Numbers:** prices ($X), quantities, percentages, measurements, distances
- **Specific Dates/Times:** For example: "Month x yth", "x:y PM/AM", "next [week day]", "in x weeks", ...
- **Named Locations:** restaurants, stores, streets, buildings, parks, venues
- **Brand/Product Names:** specific items, services, companies, tools, software
- **Yes/No Situations:** decisions made, preferences stated, conflicts resolved
- **Event Outcomes:** what happened, who won/lost, what was chosen/rejected
- **Specific Preferences:** favorite foods, colors, activities, music, books
- **Quantifiable Results:** test scores, rankings, ratings, completion times

**Detail Distribution Rules:**
- Each bullet must contain AT LEAST one verifiable detail
- Avoid vague statements like "discussed options" - specify WHAT options
- Replace "had a meeting" with "had a x PM/AM meeting at [place name] on [street name]"
- Instead of "considering choices" use "choosing between X, Y, and Z"

═══════════════ STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════
**1. OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- Generate exactly <num_batches> plans
- Format: `BATCH X PLAN` headers
- Each plan contains exactly 30 bullets
- Each bullet: "• **[LABEL CATEGORY]:[LABEL DESCRIPTION]:** [content]" (≤25 words)
- NOTE: Each label consists of category and description. Use both for each bullet point.
- Use only the provided LABELS - no custom categories
- **MANDATORY**: First bullet MUST be Temporal Anchor with the ONLY date reference in the batch

**2. STORY PROGRESSION ARCHITECTURE:**

**IF INCLUDE_INTRODUCTION = YES:**
**BATCH 1 (Story Foundation):**
- First bullet MUST be: "• **Personal Introduction:**"
- Establish initial context with SPECIFIC details (age, location, job title, salary range)
- Introduce all relationships with CONCRETE contexts (how long known, where met)
- Set up measurable goals, deadlines, and quantifiable challenges

**IF INCLUDE_INTRODUCTION = NO:**
**BATCH 1 (Continuation):**
- NO personal introduction bullets
- Begin directly with current topic-related content
- Reference established character details from PREVIOUS PLAN
- Show clear progression from previous plan's timeline and events

**BATCHES 2-<num_batches> (Story Evolution):**
- Reference user as "I/my/me" (never repeat the full name)
- Each batch advances the timeline chronologically
- Build upon ALL previously established elements
- Show MEASURABLE progression (promotions, relationship milestones, achievement metrics)

**3. RELATIONSHIP CONTINUITY SYSTEM:**

**Core vs. New Relationship Management:**
- **CORE RELATIONSHIPS** (partner, children, parents, siblings): Must remain consistent across all plans - same names, established details, ongoing dynamics
- **NEW RELATIONSHIPS** (friends, colleagues, acquaintances): Introduce naturally based on current topic and life phase
- **Relationship Integration**: New relationships should enhance the current topic while respecting established core relationship dynamics

**Relationship Evolution Mandate:**
Every relationship mention MUST include specific interaction details:

**Evolution Stages with Required Details:**
- **Introduction:** "Met [Name] at [specific place] on [date/time]"
- **Development:** "[Name] suggested [specific action] which resulted in [outcome]"
- **Deepening:** "[Name] revealed [specific information] during [specific event]"
- **Maturation:** "After [X months/years], [Name] and I [specific change]"

**Interaction Variety (rotate - never repeat within 3 batches):**
- Collaborative, Supportive, Conflictual, Social, Professional, Personal, Transactional, Serendipitous

**Character Consistency Rules:**
- **Core Characters**: Track specific preferences, established history, and ongoing relationship status
- **New Characters**: Introduce with clear context for how they fit into current topic/life phase
- Reference past specific events and their measurable consequences
- Include 2-3 relationship bullets per batch with concrete details (mix of core and new relationships)

═══════════════ CONFLICT & RESOLUTION TRACKING ═══════════════
**Mandatory Conflict Elements:**
Each batch must include at least 2-3 situations with:
- **Clear Stakes:** what's at risk (money amount, deadline, relationship status)
- **Binary Decisions:** chose A over B, accepted/rejected offer, yes/no to proposal
- **Measurable Outcomes:** gained/lost $X, saved X hours, improved by X%
- **Specific Disagreements:** who wanted what, what compromise was reached

**Conflict Types to Rotate:**
- Financial decisions with specific amounts
- Time management with exact deadlines
- Relationship boundaries with specific incidents
- Professional choices with concrete options
- Personal values with specific scenarios

═══════════════ ANTI-REPETITION VERIFICATION ═══════════════
**Before writing ANY bullet, verify:**
- Have I included at least one specific, verifiable detail?
- Can this generate a question with a one-word answer?
- Does this show MEASURABLE progression from previous mentions?
- Are the numbers, dates, names, and locations specific?
- Is this a NEW piece of information with NEW details?

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Vague time references ("recently", "soon") without specific dates
- General locations ("coffee shop", "restaurant") without names
- Unspecified amounts ("some money", "a few people")
- Abstract outcomes ("went well", "had issues") without details
- Repeated specific details (same restaurant, same activity, same problem)

═══════════════ CONTENT DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY ═══════════════
**Per Batch Requirements:**
- 2-3 bullets: Relationship developments with specific incidents (mix of core and new relationships)
- 2-4 bullets: Current situation with measurable metrics
- 1 bullet: Exact temporal anchor (specific date/time)
- 5-7 bullets: Events with verifiable outcomes
- 3-4 bullets: Decisions/preferences with specific choices
- Rest: Using remaining labels with concrete details

**Story Progression Patterns:**
- **Early Batches (1-3):** Establish baselines (current salary, relationship status, living situation)
- **Middle Batches:** Track changes from baselines with specific metrics
- **Later Batches:** Show cumulative results with before/after comparisons

═══════════════ NATURAL CONVERSATION FLOW ═══════════════
These plans generate conversations where users seek AI assistance for SPECIFIC situations:
- "Should I accept the $x job offer or stay at my $y position?"
- "The deadline is Month[] xth - can I finish all y modules by then?"
- "Sarah wants to meet at x at y PM but z suggested x1 at y1 PM"
- "My rent increased from $x to $y - should I move?"

═══════════════ QUALITY STANDARDS ═══════════════
**Specificity Checklist:**
- Every person has a full name and defined relationship
- Every event has a date, time, or specific temporal reference
- Every location has a name or address
- Every decision has concrete options with specific details
- Every outcome is measurable or verifiable

**Narrative Depth:**
- Include prices, percentages, distances, durations
- Show cause-and-effect with specific triggers and results
- Maintain factual consistency (don't change established numbers/dates)
- Reference past specific events by name and date

═══════════════ EXECUTION NOTES ═══════════════
- Prioritize concrete details over abstract descriptions
- Every bullet should enable at least 2-3 factual questions
- Include cultural, financial, and geographic specificity
- Ensure details are realistic and internally consistent
- If PREVIOUS PLAN provided, include 3-5 specific references to previous events per batch
- End immediately after `BATCH <num_batches> PLAN`

**FINAL TIMELINE REMINDER:**
- Parse TIMELINE boundaries FIRST
- EVERY date must fall within those boundaries
- NO exceptions to timeline limits
- Verify each batch respects the timeline

Output ONLY the batch plans. No explanations or additional text.

═══════════════ TECHNICAL NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK ═══════════════
This is NOT about generating random coding conversations - this is about creating a realistic, evolving technical story where:
- The developer naturally seeks AI assistance across different coding situations
- Each conversation builds upon previous technical interactions and established codebase context
- The story progresses chronologically with authentic technical skill development
- Technical relationships, projects, and technologies evolve realistically over time
- The developer's technical needs, challenges, and expertise naturally expand and deepen

═══════════════ CRITICAL NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE ═══════════════
**MANDATORY FIRST-PERSON DEVELOPER PERSPECTIVE:**
- ALL content must be written from the DEVELOPER's perspective (first-person)
- Use first-person perspective throughout but VARY sentence structures
- Natural technical narrative flow - avoid starting every bullet with "I"
- Mix active and passive voice while maintaining first-person developer perspective

═══════════════ CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════
**CRITICAL**: If PREVIOUS PLAN is provided, you MUST:
- **Reference Previous Technical Events**: Include specific callbacks to deployments, bug fixes, feature implementations, and technical decisions from the previous plan
- **Maintain Core Technical Consistency**: Keep USER PROFILE and CORE RELATIONSHIPS names and technical details exactly the same
- **Integrate New Technical Relationships**: Naturally introduce NEW RELATIONSHIPS (new team members, clients, vendors) as appropriate to the current coding topic and timeline
- **Show Technical Progression**: Demonstrate clear advancement from the previous plan's technical timeline
- **Build Upon Previous Technical Decisions**: Show consequences and follow-up implementations from previous plan choices
- **Preserve Established Technical Facts**: Keep all previously mentioned version numbers, technologies, configurations, and core relationship details consistent
- **Continue Technical Relationship Arcs**: Show evolution of existing team dynamics while adding new technical collaborators organically

═══════════════ STRICT TIMELINE ENFORCEMENT ═══════════════
**CRITICAL TIMELINE PARSING (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):**

Before generating ANY content, you MUST internally calculate timeline boundaries.

**STEP 1: Extract and Write Timeline Boundaries**
Parse TIMELINE to identify:

- Total Days Available: ________________

**STEP 2: Create Batch Date Assignments**
Divide timeline into <num_batches> segments:
- Days per batch = TOTAL DAYS ÷ <num_batches>
- Batch 1 covers: Day 1 to Day [X]
- Batch 2 covers: Day [X+1] to Day [Y]
- Continue for all batches...

**CRITICAL**: Do these calculations INTERNALLY. Do NOT write them in your output.

**ABSOLUTE TIMELINE RULES:**
1. **EVERY date mentioned MUST be between START and END dates**
2. **NO future references beyond TIMELINE END** (no "next sprint" if timeline ends this sprint)
3. **NO past references before TIMELINE START**
4. **Temporal anchors MUST progress chronologically within boundaries**
5. **Final batch MUST conclude naturally before or on END DATE**

**TEMPORAL ANCHOR REQUIREMENTS:**

You are a long-form mathematical narrative planning specialist creating a COHERENT MATH STORY PLANSET for natural student-assistant conversational flow. Your task is to generate detailed batch plans that will seed realistic student-AI dialogue about mathematical learning and problem-solving.

## INPUT DATA
- **TOPIC:** <topic>
- **THEME:** <theme>
- **TIMELINE:** <timeline>
- **NUM_BATCHES:** <num_batches> batches
- **LABELS:** <provided_labels>
- **USER_PROFILE:** <user_profile>
- **CORE_RELATIONSHIPS:** <core_relationships>
- **NEW_RELATIONSHIPS:** <new_relationships>
- **PREVIOUS_PLAN:** <previous_plan>
- **INCLUDE_INTRODUCTION:** <YES/NO>

═══════════════ CORE OBJECTIVE ═══════════════
Generate <num_batches> distinct, non-repetitive batch plans that form a coherent mathematical narrative arc where a real student naturally converses with an AI assistant. Each plan must introduce NEW mathematical elements while maintaining perfect continuity and mathematical consistency.

═══════════════ MATHEMATICAL NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK ═══════════════
This is NOT about generating random math conversations - this is about creating a realistic, evolving mathematical story where:
- The student naturally seeks AI assistance across different mathematical situations
- Each conversation builds upon previous mathematical interactions and established learning context
- The story progresses chronologically with authentic mathematical skill development
- Mathematical relationships, concepts, and understanding evolve realistically over time
- The student's mathematical needs, challenges, and expertise naturally expand and deepen

═══════════════ CRITICAL NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE ═══════════════
**MANDATORY FIRST-PERSON STUDENT PERSPECTIVE:**
- ALL content must be written from the STUDENT's perspective (first-person)
- Use first-person perspective throughout but VARY sentence structures
- Natural mathematical narrative flow - avoid starting every bullet with "I"
- Mix active and passive voice while maintaining first-person student perspective

═══════════════ CONTINUITY REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════
**CRITICAL**: If PREVIOUS PLAN is provided, you MUST:
- **Reference Previous Mathematical Events**: Include specific callbacks to problem-solving sessions, concept mastery, and mathematical decisions from the previous plan
- **Maintain Core Mathematical Consistency**: Keep USER PROFILE and CORE RELATIONSHIPS names and mathematical details exactly the same
- **Integrate New Mathematical Relationships**: Naturally introduce NEW RELATIONSHIPS (new study partners, tutors, professors) as appropriate to the current mathematical topic and timeline
- **Show Mathematical Progression**: Demonstrate clear advancement from the previous plan's mathematical timeline
- **Build Upon Previous Mathematical Decisions**: Show consequences and follow-up learning from previous plan choices
- **Preserve Established Mathematical Facts**: Keep all previously mentioned scores, concepts, formulas, and core relationship details consistent
- **Continue Mathematical Relationship Arcs**: Show evolution of existing study dynamics while adding new mathematical collaborators organically

═══════════════ STRICT TIMELINE ENFORCEMENT ═══════════════
**CRITICAL TIMELINE PARSING (MANDATORY FIRST STEP):**

Before generating ANY content, you MUST internally calculate timeline boundaries.

**STEP 1: Extract and Write Timeline Boundaries**
Parse TIMELINE to identify:
- **TIMELINE START**: [Extract exact date, e.g., "May 1, 2024"]
- **TIMELINE END**: [Extract exact date, e.g., "June 30, 2024"]
- **TOTAL DAYS**: [Calculate exact number of days]

**CALCULATE YOUR PARSED DATES:**
- Timeline Start Date: ________________
- Timeline End Date: ________________
- Total Days Available: ________________

**STEP 2: Create Batch Date Assignments**
Divide timeline into <num_batches> segments:
- Days per batch = TOTAL DAYS ÷ <num_batches>
- Batch 1 covers: Day 1 to Day [X]
- Batch 2 covers: Day [X+1] to Day [Y]
- Continue for all batches...

**CRITICAL**: Do these calculations INTERNALLY. Do NOT write them in your output.

**ABSOLUTE TIMELINE RULES:**
1. **EVERY date mentioned MUST be between START and END dates**
2. **NO future references beyond TIMELINE END** (no "next semester" if timeline ends this semester)
3. **NO past references before TIMELINE START**
4. **Temporal anchors MUST progress chronologically within boundaries**
5. **Final batch MUST conclude naturally before or on END DATE**

**TEMPORAL ANCHOR REQUIREMENTS:**
- First bullet of EACH batch MUST be temporal anchor
- Format: "• **Temporal Anchor:** [Month] [Day], [year], [mathematical event description]"
- Each temporal anchor date MUST be within that batch's assigned date range
- Dates must progress: Batch 2's date > Batch 1's date, etc.

**TIMELINE VIOLATION EXAMPLES (FORBIDDEN):**
Timeline is "May-June" but mentioning "July exams"
Timeline is "May-June" but saying "next semester" in late June
Timeline starts May 1 but referencing "last month's quiz results"
Any date outside the [START DATE] to [END DATE] range

- Maintain relationship continuity
- Honor previously mentioned dates/plans
- Show progression from previous subtopic's ending

═══════════════ TIMELINE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY ═══════════════

**MANDATORY TIMELINE PARSING:**

1. **Parse Current Subtopic Timeline:**
   - START: [Extract from TIMELINE]
   - END: [Extract from TIMELINE]
   - DURATION: [Calculate in days/months]

2. **Calculate Timeline Distribution Method:**
   - Total Days = END - START + 1
   - IF Total Days >= <num_batches>:
     - Days per Batch = Total Days ÷ <num_batches>
     - Each batch gets unique date progression
   - IF Total Days < <num_batches>:
     - Use grouped date distribution to maintain coherence

3. **Create Batch Timeline Segments:**

   **FOR TIMELINES WITH SUFFICIENT DAYS (Total Days >= <num_batches>):**
   - Batch 1: Days 1-X of timeline
   - Batch 2: Days X+1-Y of timeline
   - Continue sequential progression for all batches

   **FOR SHORT TIMELINES (Total Days < <num_batches>):**
   - Calculate batches per day: <num_batches> ÷ Total Days
   - Group consecutive batches to same date
   - Distribute evenly across available dates
   - Example pattern for X available days:
     - First [batches_per_day] batches: Day 1
     - Next [batches_per_day] batches: Day 2
     - Continue until all batches assigned
   - Ensure each available day gets equal batch distribution
   - Maintain chronological order within same-day batches

4. **Batch Content Differentiation for Same-Day Batches:**
   - When multiple batches share same date, differentiate by:
     - Time of day progression (morning → afternoon → evening)
     - Activity focus areas within the day
     - Different stakeholder perspectives
     - Various aspects of same-day experiences
     - Progressive depth of engagement

5. **Verify Against Action Dates:**
   - EVERY date must respect phase boundaries
   - NO date can violate the action date rules above
   - Maintain logical progression even with repeated dates
   - Ensure content advancement despite date repetition

- **INCLUDE_INTRODUCTION:** <YES/NO>

═══════════════ CORE OBJECTIVE ═══════════════
Generate <num_batches> distinct, non-repetitive batch plans that form a coherent technical narrative arc where a real developer naturally converses with an AI assistant. Each plan must introduce NEW coding elements while maintaining perfect continuity and technical consistency.

═══════════════ TECHNICAL NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK ═══════════════
This is NOT about generating random coding conversations - this is about creating a realistic, evolving technical story where:
- The developer naturally seeks AI assistance across different coding situations
- Each conversation builds upon previous technical interactions and established codebase context
- Technical relationships, projects, and technologies evolve realistically over time
- The developer's technical needs, challenges, and expertise naturally expand and deepen

═══════════════ CRITICAL NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE ═══════════════

**MANDATORY FIRST-PERSON DEVELOPER PERSPECTIVE:**
- ALL content must be written from the DEVELOPER's perspective (first-person)
- Use first-person perspective throughout but VARY sentence structures
- Natural technical narrative flow - avoid starting every bullet with "I"
- Mix active and passive voice while maintaining first-person developer perspective

═══════════════ CRITICAL TECHNICAL DETAIL REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════

**MANDATORY SPECIFIC TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
Every batch MUST include numerous concrete, verifiable technical details that enable single-word or short factual answers:

**Required Technical Detail Categories (minimum 8-10 per batch):**
- **Exact Numbers:** version numbers (v2.3.1), port numbers (3000), response times (250ms), file sizes (2.5MB), memory usage (512MB), CPU usage (45%), database records (50,000), concurrent users (1,200), build times (3m 15s)
- **Specific Dates/Times:** deployment dates, sprint deadlines, meeting times, build timestamps, release schedules, maintenance windows, code review deadlines
- **Named Technologies:** specific frameworks, libraries, tools, services (React 18.2, PostgreSQL 14, AWS Lambda, Docker 20.10, Node.js 18.16, Express 4.18.2)
- **Error Messages:** exact error texts, status codes (404, 500), stack trace snippets, exception types (TypeError, ReferenceError), HTTP response codes
- **Yes/No Situations:** feature implemented, bug fixed, test passed, deployment successful, code review approved, merge completed, CI/CD pipeline passed
- **Performance Metrics:** load times (2.3s), query speeds (150ms), memory usage (1.2GB), API response times (200ms), uptime (99.9%), throughput (500 req/sec), test execution time (45s)
- **Configuration Details:** environment variables (NODE_ENV=production), API endpoints (/api/v1/users), database schemas, server configurations (nginx.conf), network settings (port 8080)
- **Quantifiable Results:** test coverage (85%), uptime (99.9%), user count (1,000+), bug count (12 open), code quality score (8.5/10), build success rate (96%), security vulnerabilities (3 critical)

**Technical Detail Distribution Rules:**
- Each bullet must contain AT LEAST one verifiable technical detail
- Avoid vague statements like "worked on feature" - specify WHAT feature and HOW
- Replace "had a bug" with "encountered 'undefined is not a function' error in UserAuth.js line 42"
- Instead of "improved performance" use "reduced API response time from 800ms to 200ms"
- Replace "deployed code" with "deployed v1.2.3 to production at 2:30 PM, serving 1,500 concurrent users"
- Instead of "fixed database issue" use "optimized PostgreSQL query reducing execution time from 2.1s to 300ms"
- Replace "completed testing" with "achieved 92% test coverage with 147 unit tests passing in 2m 30s"

═══════════════ CRITICAL STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- Generate exactly <num_batches> plans
- Format: `BATCH X PLAN` headers (NO timeline headers)
- Each plan contains exactly 30 bullets
- Each bullet: "• **[LABEL CATEGORY]:[LABEL DESCRIPTION]:** [detailed technical content with specific facts]" (≤30 words)
- NOTE: Each label consists of category and description. Use both for each bullet point.
- Use only the provided LABELS - no custom categories
- **MANDATORY**: First bullet MUST be Temporal Anchor with the ONLY date reference in the batch

**TEMPORAL ANCHOR RULES:**
- **ONLY the first bullet** of each batch contains a date
- **NO OTHER BULLET** in the batch should include dates
- **Format**: "• **Temporal Anchor:** [Specific date], [rich technical contextual explanation of what's happening and why it's significant]"
- All other bullets refer to technical activities happening "around this time" without specific dates

- Build upon prior technical decisions and learnings
- Maintain technical relationship continuity
- Honor previously mentioned deployment dates/technical plans
- Show technical progression from previous subtopic's ending

═══════════════ TIMELINE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY ═══════════════

**MANDATORY TIMELINE PARSING:**

1. **Parse Current Subtopic Timeline:**
   - START: [Extract from TIMELINE]
   - END: [Extract from TIMELINE]
   - DURATION: [Calculate in days/months]

2. **Calculate Timeline Distribution Method:**
   - Total Days = END - START + 1
   - IF Total Days >= <num_batches>:
     - Days per Batch = Total Days ÷ <num_batches>
     - Each batch gets unique date progression
   - IF Total Days < <num_batches>:
     - Use grouped date distribution to maintain coherence

3. **Create Batch Timeline Segments:**

   **FOR TIMELINES WITH SUFFICIENT DAYS (Total Days >= <num_batches>):**
   - Batch 1: Days 1-X of timeline
   - Batch 2: Days X+1-Y of timeline
   - Continue sequential progression for all batches

   **FOR SHORT TIMELINES (Total Days < <num_batches>):**
   - Calculate batches per day: <num_batches> ÷ Total Days
   - Group consecutive batches to same date
   - Distribute evenly across available dates
   - Example pattern for X available days:
     - First [batches_per_day] batches: Day 1
     - Next [batches_per_day] batches: Day 2
     - Continue until all batches assigned
   - Ensure each available day gets equal batch distribution
   - Maintain chronological order within same-day batches

4. **Batch Technical Content Differentiation for Same-Day Batches:**
   - When multiple batches share same date, differentiate by:
     - Time of day progression (morning standup → afternoon coding → evening deployment)
     - Technical focus areas within the day
     - Different technical stakeholder perspectives
     - Various aspects of same-day development experiences
     - Progressive technical depth of engagement

5. **Verify Against Development Dates:**
   - EVERY date must respect technical phase boundaries
   - NO date can violate the development date rules above
   - Maintain logical technical progression even with repeated dates
   - Ensure technical content advancement despite date repetition

═══════════════ MANDATORY CONTENT BOUNDARY EXTRACTION ═══════════════

═══════════════ MATHEMATICAL NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK ═══════════════
This is NOT about generating random mathematical conversations - this is about creating a realistic, evolving mathematical story where:
- The student naturally seeks AI assistance across different mathematical situations
- Each conversation builds upon previous mathematical interactions and established learning context
- Mathematical relationships, concepts, and understanding evolve realistically over time
- The student's mathematical needs, challenges, and expertise naturally expand and deepen

═══════════════ CRITICAL NARRATIVE PERSPECTIVE ═══════════════

**MANDATORY FIRST-PERSON STUDENT PERSPECTIVE:**
- ALL content must be written from the STUDENT's perspective (first-person)
- Use first-person perspective throughout but VARY sentence structures
- Natural mathematical narrative flow - avoid starting every bullet with "I"
- Mix active and passive voice while maintaining first-person student perspective

═══════════════ CRITICAL MATHEMATICAL DETAIL REQUIREMENTS ═══════════════

     - Days per Batch = Total Days ÷ <num_batches>
     - Each batch gets unique date progression
   - IF Total Days < <num_batches>:
     - Use grouped date distribution to maintain coherence

3. **Create Batch Timeline Segments:**

   **FOR TIMELINES WITH SUFFICIENT DAYS (Total Days >= <num_batches>):**
   - Batch 1: Days 1-X of timeline
   - Batch 2: Days X+1-Y of timeline
   - Continue sequential progression for all batches

   **FOR SHORT TIMELINES (Total Days < <num_batches>):**
   - Calculate batches per day: <num_batches> ÷ Total Days
   - Group consecutive batches to same date
   - Distribute evenly across available dates
   - Example pattern for X available days:
     - First [batches_per_day] batches: Day 1
     - Next [batches_per_day] batches: Day 2
     - Continue until all batches assigned
   - Ensure each available day gets equal batch distribution
   - Maintain chronological order within same-day batches

4. **Batch Mathematical Content Differentiation for Same-Day Batches:**
   - When multiple batches share same date, differentiate by:
     - Time of day progression (morning study → afternoon practice → evening review)
     - Mathematical focus areas within the day
     - Different mathematical stakeholder perspectives
     - Various aspects of same-day mathematical experiences
     - Progressive mathematical depth of engagement

5. **Verify Against Study Dates:**
   - EVERY date must respect mathematical phase boundaries

This is a plan that contains detailed bullet points about a topic. This plan is used to generate realistic chat conversations between a user and an AI assistant, which are then used to evaluate the long-term memory capabilities of LLMs. 

Your task is to analyze this plan and select GROUPS of related bullet points that would be most effective for testing event ordering abilities when incorporated into chat conversations.

Event ordering tests whether the LLM can recall the chronological order in which events or topics were MENTIONED in the conversation, regardless of when the actual events occurred in real life.

Analyze this plan and identify GROUPS of 8-12 or more related bullet points that represent the same topic/theme mentioned across different batches, enabling testing of mention-order recall and conversation sequence understanding.

## INPUT DATA
- **PLAN**: <plan>

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: EARLY BATCH PRIORITIZATION
**SELECTION PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. **Groups starting in Batches 1-3 (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**: Select 70-80% of your groups with first mention in early batches
2. **Groups spanning early to middle batches (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**: Select 10-20% of groups that bridge early-to-middle timeline
3. **Groups from later batches only (LOW PRIORITY)**: Select only 5-10% from purely later batches

Focus on bullet point groups that show:
- **Same person mentioned multiple times**: Different interactions or mentions of the same person across batches
- **Same component/process discussed repeatedly**: Multiple mentions of the same equipment, material, or process
- **Same location/venue referenced**: Multiple mentions of the same place or address
- **Same decision/topic revisited**: The same subject brought up in different conversation sessions
- **Same problem/solution mentioned**: Multiple references to the same issue across different times
- **Same financial item tracked**: Multiple mentions of the same cost, budget item, or expense

Prioritize bullet point groups that:
- Contain 8-12 mentions of the same topic across different batches
- Enable questions about "In what order events X,Y,Z,... happen?" Or ...
- Allow testing of conversation chronology rather than real-world event chronology  
- Test recall of mention sequence: "Which did I talk about first, second, third?"
- Focus on the order topics appeared in conversation, not when events actually happened
- Create opportunities to test conversational memory rather than factual timeline memory

Return your analysis in this exact JSON format where each object contains 3+ bullet points about the same topic across different batches:

contradiction_resolution_prompt = """
This is a plan that contains detailed bullet points about a topic. This plan is used to generate realistic chat conversations between a user and an AI assistant, which are then used to evaluate the long-term memory capabilities of LLMs. 

Your task is to analyze this plan and select PAIRS of bullet points that would be most effective for testing contradiction resolution abilities when incorporated into chat conversations.

Contradiction resolution tests whether the LLM can detect and appropriately handle impossible contradictions - statements that logically cannot both be true simultaneously.

Analyze this project plan and identify PAIRS of bullet points where one completely contradicts the other with impossible contradictions. Each pair should contain statements that are logically incompatible and cannot both be true.

## INPUT DATA
- **PLAN**: <plan>

Focus on bullet point pairs that show:
- **Never-Statement Violations**: One bullet says "never" did something, another shows they did it
- **Always-Statement Violations**: One bullet claims "always" pattern, another breaks that pattern  
- **Only-Statement Conflicts**: One bullet claims exclusivity ("only"), another contradicts it
- **Impossible Reversals**: Age going backward, timeline impossibilities, logical reversals
- **Dead-Alive Contradictions**: References to deceased people being active
- **Mutually Exclusive States**: Being in two places simultaneously, having contradictory capabilities
- **Absolute Negations**: Claiming something is impossible then showing it happened

**Types of Impossible Contradictions to look for:**
1. **Never-Statement Violations**: "Never attended X" vs "Attended X event"
2. **Always-Statement Violations**: "Always lived in Y" vs "Moved from Z to Y"  
3. **Only-Statement Conflicts**: "Only child" vs "Has siblings"
4. **Timeline Impossibilities**: Events happening in wrong chronological order
5. **Capability Contradictions**: "Cannot do X" vs "Successfully did X"
6. **Location Impossibilities**: Being in two places at once
7. **Relationship Contradictions**: "Never met person" vs "Long friendship with person"

Prioritize bullet point pairs that:
- Contain completely impossible contradictions that cannot be resolved or explained
- Use absolute language ("never," "always," "only," "impossible," "cannot")
- Create clear logical impossibilities rather than simple inconsistencies
- Enable questions about detecting fundamental contradictions
- Test whether the AI can identify when statements are mutually exclusive
- Focus on contradictions that are objectively impossible, not subjective differences

Return your analysis in this exact JSON format where each object contains exactly TWO contradicting bullet points:

Important formatting notes:
- The "batch_numbers" and "bullet_numbers" correspond to each other positionally
- "1, 8" and "30, 29" means: Batch 1 Bullet 30, Batch 8 Bullet 29
- Each object must contain exactly 2 bullet points separated by " | "
- Use comma-separated values for batch_number and bullet_number
- First bullet point can be the contradiction marker or the contradicted statement
- Second bullet point should directly contradict the first with impossible logic

- **If testing information from ASSISTANT messages**: Use second person ("you", "your") in question → Answer uses ("I", "my") 
  - Example: "What steps did you suggest for handling this?" → "I suggested doing..."
- Avoid phrases like "according to the conversation", "based on what was discussed"
- Make questions sound conversational and natural
- Questions should require deep temporal reasoning to answer

## CHAT ID TRACKING REQUIREMENT
- You MUST identify which specific chat_id(s) contain the temporal information for both events

## FORBIDDEN QUESTION ELEMENTS
- Do NOT list specific events like "including X, Y, and Z"
- Do NOT mention specific details, dates, times, or temporal references
- Do NOT provide hints about what mentions to look for
- Do NOT reference specific timeframes (e.g., "in February", "during spring", "early in project")
- Do NOT use temporal words like "first", "then", "after", "before" in the question

## GOOD VS BAD EXAMPLES
BAD (Time Hints): "In what order did I mention Rami from February to August?"
BAD (Event Spoilers): "What was the sequence of meeting, site visit, and final consultation?"
BAD (Temporal References): "Which Rami interactions did I discuss first, then second?"

GOOD (General): "In what order did I mention different interactions with Rami?"
GOOD (Pattern): "What pattern do you see in how I brought up budget concerns?"
GOOD (Development): "How did my discussions about contractor issues evolve?"

## ORDERING COMPLEXITY LEVEL: HARD

# ################################################## LLM Judge prompts ##################################################

unified_llm_judge_base_prompt = """
You are an expert evaluator tasked with judging whether the LLM's response demonstrates compliance with the specified RUBRIC CRITERION.

## EVALUATION INPUTS
- RUBRIC CRITERION (what to check): <rubric_item>
- RESPONSE TO EVALUATE: <llm_response>

## EVALUATION RUBRIC:
The rubric defines a specific requirement, constraint, or expected behavior that the LLM response should demonstrate. 

**IMPORTANT**: Pay careful attention to whether the rubric specifies:
- **Positive requirements** (things the response SHOULD include/do)
- **Negative constraints** (things the response SHOULD NOT include/do, often indicated by "no", "not", "avoid", "absent")

## RESPONSIVENESS REQUIREMENT
A compliant response must be **on-topic** and attempt to answer it.
- If the response does not address the QUESTION, score **0.0** and stop.
- For negative constraints, both must hold: (a) the response is responsive to the QUESTION, and (b) the prohibited element is absent.

## SEMANTIC TOLERANCE RULES:
Judge by meaning, not exact wording.
- Accept **paraphrases** and **synonyms** that preserve intent.
- **Case/punctuation/whitespace** differences must be ignored.
- **Numbers/currencies/dates** may appear in equivalent forms (e.g., “$68,000”, “68k”, “68,000 USD”, or “sixty-eight thousand dollars”). Treat them as equal when numerically equivalent.
- If the rubric expects a number or duration, prefer **normalized comparison** (extract and compare values) over string matching.

## STYLE NEUTRALITY (prevents style contamination):
Ignore tone, politeness, length, and flourish unless the rubric explicitly requires a format/structure (e.g., “itemized list”, “no citations”, “one sentence”).
- Do **not** penalize hedging, voice, or verbosity if content satisfies the rubric.
- Only evaluate format when the rubric **explicitly** mandates it.

## SCORING SCALE:
- **1.0 (Complete Compliance)**: Fully complies with the rubric criterion.
  - Positive: required element present, accurate, properly executed (allowing semantic equivalents).
  - Negative: prohibited element **absent** AND response is **responsive**.
  
- **0.5 (Partial Compliance)**: Partially complies.
  - Positive: element present but minor inaccuracies/incomplete execution.
  - Negative: generally responsive and mostly avoids the prohibited element but with minor/edge violations.
  
- **0.0 (No Compliance)**: Fails to comply.
  - Positive: required element missing or incorrect.
  - Negative: prohibited element present **or** response is non-responsive/evasive even if the element is absent.

## EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Understand the Requirement**: Determine if the rubric is asking for something to be present (positive) or absent (negative/constraint).

2. **Parse Compound Statements**: If the rubric contains multiple elements connected by "and" or commas, evaluate whether:
   - **All elements** must be present for full compliance (1.0)
   - **Some elements** present indicates partial compliance (0.5)
   - **No elements** present indicates no compliance (0.0)
   
3. **Check Compliance**: 
   - For positive requirements: Look for the presence and quality of the required element
   - For negative constraints: Look for the absence of the prohibited element

4. **Assign Score**: Based on compliance with the specific rubric criterion according to the scoring scale above.

5. **Provide Reasoning**: Explain whether the rubric criterion was satisfied and justify the score.

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return your evaluation in JSON format with two fields:

{
   "score": [your score: 1.0, 0.5, or 0.0],
   "reason": "[detailed explanation of whether the rubric criterion was satisfied and why this justified the assigned score]"
}

NOTE: ONLY output the json object, without any explanation before or after that

break_paragraph_to_facts_detailed_prompt = """
You are tasked with breaking down a paragraph or sentence into individual semantic fact units. Each fact unit should represent one distinct, atomic piece of information that can be independently verified or evaluated.

DEFINITION OF SEMANTIC FACT UNIT:
- A single, complete piece of information
- Cannot be broken down further without losing meaning
- Contains one main claim or statement
- Is independently verifiable
- Has clear subject-predicate relationship

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Split compound sentences at conjunctions (and, but, or, so, etc.)
2. Separate temporal information into distinct facts
3. Break down lists into individual items
4. Isolate causal relationships (because, since, therefore)
5. Separate descriptive attributes from main statements
6. Extract numerical data as separate facts when relevant
7. Maintain context necessary for understanding each fact

QUESTION-BASED EXTRACTION NECESSITY:
- Identify what the question is asking for (who, what, when, where, why, how, how much, etc.)
- Extract semantic units that directly answer the question first
- Include supporting details and context as separate fact units
- Ensure extracted facts are meaningful in relation to the question asked

EXAMPLES:

INPUT: "John visited the store on Monday and bought three apples for $5, but he forgot to get milk because the dairy section was closed."

OUTPUT:
1. "John visited the store on Monday"
2. "John bought three apples"
3. "The apples cost $5"
4. "John forgot to get milk"
5. "The dairy section was closed"
6. "John forgot milk because the dairy section was closed"

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Extract ALL semantic fact units from the given text
- Number each fact unit sequentially
- Maintain factual accuracy - do not add or infer information
- Preserve important context within each fact unit
- Ensure each fact can stand alone as a meaningful statement
- DO NOT add any explanation before or after the text

QUESTION:
<question>

ANSWER TO EXTRACT FACTS FROM:
<input_text>

OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. [First semantic fact unit]
2. [Second semantic fact unit]
3. [Third semantic fact unit]
